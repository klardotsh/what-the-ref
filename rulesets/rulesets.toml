# Technically I tend to pull text from the HTML version of the manual, eg.
# https://ftc-resources.firstinspires.org/file/ftc/game/cm-html/Competition%20Manual%20-%20V4.1.htm.
# This page is usually in varying degrees of brokenness and is not fit for
# linking to directly, but it's far nicer to copy text from than the PDFs.
