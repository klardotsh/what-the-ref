# G14: Robot Starting Volume

Before the start of a |Match|, each |Robot| in its starting location must not
exceed a volume of 18 inches (457.2 mm) by 18 inches (457.2 mm) by 18 inches
(457.2 mm). Flexible materials (i.e., zip tie, surgical tube, string, etc.)
may extend up to 0.25 inches (0.635 cm) beyond the 18-inch (45.72 cm) size
constraint. A |Pre-Loaded| |Scoring Element| may extend |Outside| the 18-inch
(457.2 mm) cube volume constraint. Once a violation has been identified, if
the |Team| cannot fix the violation within thirty (30) seconds, the offending
|Robot| will be removed from the |Playing Field|. |Robots| removed from the
field are not subject to a delay of game (<G13>e) |Penalty|. The |Team| remains
eligible to earn Ranking and TieBreaker Points if a member of the |Drive Team|
is in their |Alliance Station| during the |Match|.

After the start of a |Match|, the |Robot| may extend in any direction unless
otherwise specified by the Game-Specific rules detailed in section 4.5.3.
