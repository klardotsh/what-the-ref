# G09: Match Replay

|Matches| are replayed at the discretion of the head referee only for a failure
of a non- |Team| supplied |Game or Field Element| or verified Wi-Fi interference
that was likely to have impacted which |Alliance| won the |Match|.

Unexpected |Robot| behavior will not result in a |Match| replay. |Team|-induced
failures, such as low battery conditions, processor sleep time-outs, |Robot|
mechanical, electrical, software, or communication failures, etc. are NOT valid
justifications for a replaying of a |Match|.
