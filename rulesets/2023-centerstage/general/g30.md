# G30: Egregious Behavior

Egregious |Robot| or |Team| member behavior is not in the spirit of Gracious
Professionalism and will not be tolerated at a FIRST Tech Challenge event.
Egregious behavior includes, but is not limited to, repeated and/or flagrant
violation of rules, unsafe behavior or actions, or uncivil behavior towards
volunteers, |Drive Team|, competition personnel, or event attendees. In most
cases, as determined by the referees, the offending team will result in a |
Major Penalty| and issuance of a |Yellow Card| and/or |Red Card|. Subsequent
violations may result in |Team| disqualification from the competition.

Continued and repeated violations will be brought to FIRST Headquartersâ€™
attention. FIRST Headquarters will work with event staff to determine if further
escalations are necessary, which can include removal from award consideration
and removal from the event.

In cases where the egregious behavior is deemed to be unsafe, such as physical
contact or threatening behaviors to other event attendees, event staff will work
with FIRST Headquarters to determine if the behavior warrants immediate removal
of the team from the event.
