# G13: Pre-Match Robot Placement

At the beginning of a |Match|, each |Alliance| |Robot| must be set up on the |
Playing Field| according to section 4.4.1 Pre-|Match|. After |Robots| are set
up on the |Playing Field|, |Drive Teams| must stand |Inside| their respective |
Alliance Station|.

1. During the Qualification |Matches|, the blue |Alliance| |Robots| are set up
on the |Playing Field| first, unless the red |Alliance| waives their right to
set up on the |Playing Field| second.

2. During the Elimination |Matches|, the 3rd and 4th seeded |Alliance| |Robots|
are set up on the |Playing Field| first, unless the higher seeded |Alliance|
waives their right to set up on the |Playing Field| second. |Alliance| color
doesn’t change the seeding of a |Team| during the Elimination |Matches|. If the
4th seed defeats the 1st seed in the Semi-Finals, they will still have to place
their |Robot| on the field first in the finals because their seeding will be
lower than the 2nd or 3rd seed.

3. During Elimination |Matches|, three |Team| |Alliances| may only place two |
Robots| that are intended to compete in that |Match|. After the |Robots| are
placed, the |Alliance| cannot swap in the 3rd |Alliance|’s |Robot| for a |Robot|
already placed.

4. |Teams| may implicitly waive their right to place their |Robots| on the |
Playing Field| last by placing their |Robots| on the |Playing Field| before or
with the opposing |Alliance|. There is no need to tell the referees; |Teams|
waive their right by the act of placing their |Robots| on the |Playing Field|.

5. |Teams| that unnecessarily delay the beginning of a |Match| and/or field
reset will incur a |Minor Penalty| for each offense. Significant delays may
escalate to a |Major Penalty| at the discretion of the head referee.

> |Drive Teams| are expected to stage their |Robots| for a |Match|, and remove
it from the |Playing Field| afterwards, safely and swiftly. |Drive Team| efforts
that either intentionally or unintentionally delay the start of a |Match| or the
|Playing Field| reset are not allowed. Examples include, but are not limited to:
>
> - Late arrival to the |Playing Field|.
> - Robot maintenance once on the |Playing Field|.
>
> If the field is waiting for the |Team|, they would be subject to this |
Penalty|.
