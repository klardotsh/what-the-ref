# G24: Robots Deliberately Detaching Parts

|Robots| may not deliberately detach parts during a |Match| or leave mechanisms
on the |Playing Field| unless permitted by a Game-Specific rule. |Possessed| or
|Controlled| |Scoring Elements| are not considered to be a part of the |Robot|
for the purpose of this rule. The consequence of deliberately detaching a part
is a |Minor Penalty| if it does not |Block| an opposing |Alliance| |Robot|, |
Alliance Specific| |Scoring Element| or |Scoring Area|. If a deliberately
detached component or mechanism affects gameplay by any |Robot|, the offending
|Robot| will receive a |Major Penalty| and will be issued a |Yellow Card|. |
Robot| parts that are released but remain connected by a tether are considered
detached for the purposes of this rule.

> Tethered components that move independently of the main |Robot| are considered
a detached component and are illegal.
