# G16: Alliance Stations

During a |Match|, the |Drive Team| must remain |In| their |Alliance Station|.

1. |Drive Teams| may be anywhere in their respective Alliance or |Human Player
Station|.
2. The first instance of leaving the Alliance or |Human Player Station| will
result in a |Warning|, with any following instances during the |Match| resulting
in a |Minor Penalty|. Leaving the Alliance or |Human Player Station| for safety
reasons will not result in a |Warning| or |Penalty|.
3. Opposing |Alliance|’s |Drive Team| members cannot distract/interfere with
each other or the off-field |Scoring Elements| (if present in the current
season’s challenge). Violations of this rule will result in an immediate |Major
Penalty| and a possible |Yellow Card|.
4. After |Robots| are set up on the |Playing Field|, and before the |Match|
starts, |Drive Teams| must stand |Inside| their respective |Alliance| or |Human
Player Station|. Once the |Match| starts, the members of the |Drive Teams| may
stand, sit, or kneel for the remainder of the |Match|. Violations of this rule
(for example, lying down in the |Alliance Station|) will result in a |Minor
Penalty|. Repeated violations of this rule will be handled per rule <G30>

> The intent of this rule is to prevent |Drive Team| members from leaving
their assigned |Station| during a |Match| to gain a competitive advantage. For
example, moving to another part of the |Field| for better viewing, reaching into
the |Field|, etc. Simply breaking the plane of the |Station| during normal |
Match| play is not a |Penalty|.
