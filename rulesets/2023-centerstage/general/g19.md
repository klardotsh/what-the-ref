# G19: Late Start of the Autonomous Period

A |Drive Team| that starts their |Robot|â€™s |Autonomous| Op Mode late will
receive a |Minor Penalty|. Any delay in |Robot| movement must be done by its
programming. Referees have the option of issuing a |Major Penalty| in place of
the |Minor Penalty| if the late start results in a competitive advantage for the
offending |Alliance|.
