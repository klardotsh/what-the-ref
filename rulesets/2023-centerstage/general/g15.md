# G15: Robot Setup Alignment

|Teams| may align their |Robots| during Pre-|Match| setup if they do so with
legal components that are part of the |Robot| and can be reset to be within
the 18-inch (457.2 mm) cube starting volume constraint. |Robot| setup alignment
devices that extend outside the 18-inch starting volume constraint cannot be
powered. A single member of the |Drive Team| may also align the |Robot| by sight
if they are next to the |Robot| and their action does not delay the start of a
|Match|. A |Minor Penalty| will be assessed to the |Alliance| for violation of
this rule.
