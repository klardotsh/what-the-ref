# G22: Drive Team Contact with the Playing Field or Robot

During a |Match|, the |Drive Team| is prohibited from making contact with the
|Playing Field|, any |Robot|, or any |Game Element| unless allowed by Game-
Specific rules. The first instance of contact will result in a |Warning|, with
any following instances during the competition resulting in a |Minor Penalty|.
Contact that affects |Scoring| and/or gameplay will result in issuance of a |
Yellow Card| at the discretion of the referees. Contact with the |Playing
Field|, a |Game Element|, or a |Robot| for safety reasons will not result in a |
Warning| or |Penalty|.

> For example, a |Game Element| is |Launched| from a |Robot| on the |Playing
Field| and it |Inadvertently| hits a |Team| member in the |Alliance Station| and
is deflected back onto the field. The |Team| would not receive a <G22> |Penalty|
because the |Team| member was protecting themself (safety). However, if that
same |Game Element| is caught and/or directed to a specific location on the |
Playing Field|, the |Team| may be issued a <G22> |Penalty|.
