# G20: Robot Actions at End of the Period

1. |Robots| must |Park| at the end of the |Autonomous| and |Driver-Controlled|
Periods. |Robots| that are not |Parked| at the **conclusion** of the “game
sound” receive a |Minor Penalty| and the following actions of the |Robot| do
not count towards their |Alliance|’s Score. |Drive Teams| should make their
best effort to stop gameplay immediately when the |End of the Period| game sound
begins. Referees have the option of issuing a |Major Penalty| in place of the |
Minor Penalty| if the late stop results in a competitive advantage (other than |
Scoring|) for the offending |Alliance|.
2. |Scoring| achievements that were started (unless disallowed by Game-Specific
rules) before the |End of the Period| are eligible to be counted as |Scored|.
3. |Robot| |Scoring| achievements that occur after the announced |End of the
Autonomous Period| and before the start of the |Driver-Controlled Period| do not
count towards the |Score| for the |Autonomous| or |Driver- Controlled Periods|.
