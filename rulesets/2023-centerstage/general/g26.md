# G26: Destruction, Damage, Tipping, etc.

|Robot| actions aimed at the destruction, damage, tipping over, or entanglement
of |Robots| or |Game Elements| are not in the spirit of the FIRST Tech Challenge
and are not allowed unless permitted by Game-Specific rules. However, FIRST Tech
Challenge games are highly interactive. |Robot|-to-|Robot| contact and defensive
gameplay should be expected. |Robot| interactions that result in tipping,
entanglement, or impair the functions of an opposing |Alliance|â€™s |Robot| may
result in a |Major Penalty| and/or a |Yellow card|.
