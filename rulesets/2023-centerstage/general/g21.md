During the |Autonomous Period|, |Drive Teams| may not directly or indirectly
control or interact with |Robots| or |Driver Stations|. Early stopping of the |
Robot| while running its |Autonomous| code is not allowed, except in cases of
personal or equipment safety, and any achievements earned due to early stoppage
will not |Score| points. A |Major Penalty| will be assessed for violating
this rule. |Teams| that stop their |Robots| during the |Autonomous Period| are
allowed to participate in the |Driver-Controlled Period| provided it can be
done safely.
