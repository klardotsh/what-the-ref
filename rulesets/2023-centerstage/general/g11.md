# G11: Illegal Match Communication

Electronic communication (cell phone, two-way radio, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.) by
|Drive Team| members after an |Alliance| has been called from the queue to the |
Playing Field| for its |Match| is not allowed. The first instance of violating
this rule will result in a |Warning|, with any following instances during the
competition resulting in a |Minor Penalty|. Items that may be mistaken by a
casual observer as being in violation of this rule should not be brought to the
|Playing Field|. The |Driver Station| is exempt from this rule but must be used
only for operating the |Robot|.
