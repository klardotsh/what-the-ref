# G08: Playing Field Tolerances

Competition provided |Playing Field| and |Game Elements| will start each |Match|
with tolerances that may vary by +/-1.0 inch (25.4 mm). |Teams| must design
their |Robots| accordingly.

> |Playing Field| and |Game Elements| are expected to be manufactured,
assembled, and set up using a high standard for dimensional and location
accuracy. The intent of the generous +/- 1.0 inch tolerance is to accommodate
unintentional size and location variations that may occur. The tolerance is not
an excuse for intentional or imprecise accuracy in construction or setup.
