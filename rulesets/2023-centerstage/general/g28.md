# G28: Pinning, Trapping, or Blocking Robots

A |Robot| may not cause an opposing |Alliance| |Robot| to become |Pinned|, |
Trapped|, or |Blocked|.

Once a referee determines this rule is being violated, a |Minor Penalty| will be
assessed for every 5 seconds the violation continues.

A |Robot| is in violation until it has moved at least 3 feet (0.9 m),
approximately 1.5 Tiles, from the |Pinned|, |Trapped|, or |Blocked| |Robot|.

During the |Autonomous Period|, |Robots| will not incur this |Penalty| unless
it is determined by the referee to be part of a deliberate strategy, which will
then be penalized as described above. If the violation happens during the |
Autonomous Period|, the first action done by the offending |Robot| during the |
Driver-Controlled Period| must be to move away from the |Pinned|, |Trapped|, or
|Blocked| |Robot| or a |Minor Penalty| will be assessed immediately and again
for every five-seconds that they are in violation. Game-Specific rule(s) listed
in section 4.5.3 that further define |Pinning|, |Trapping|, or |Blocking| take
precedence over this general game rule

> The intent of this rule is that |Drive Teams| begin to immediately move their
|Robots| away and have a five second grace period to move the required distance.
The grace period is not permission to intentionally |Block|/|Pin|/|Trap| for up
to five seconds.
