# G02: Score Certification at the End of the Match

|Scores| will be tracked by field personnel throughout the |Autonomous| and |
Driver-Controlled| Periods of the |Match|. At the |End of the Match|, the final
|Score| will be certified as quickly as possible. A change in state of a |
Game Element| or |Robot| at the |End of the Match| after its final |Score| is
recorded will not change an already-recorded |Score|. |Scoring Elements| will
not be recounted after the |End of the Match| unless otherwise specified by a
Game-Specific rule.
