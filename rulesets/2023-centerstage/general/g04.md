# G04: Robot Manipulation of Scoring Elements

|Scoring Elements| that are |Controlled| or |Possessed| by a |Robot| are part
of the |Robot| except when determining the location of the |Robot| or otherwise
specified by a Game-Specific rule.

> For Example: If a |Robot| |Possesses| a |Scoring Element|, and only that |
Scoring Element| breaks the plane of a |Scoring Area|, the |Robot| does not
receive points for being |In| that |Area|.
