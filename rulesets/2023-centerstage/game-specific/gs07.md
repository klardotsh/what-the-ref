# GS07: Stage Door Constraints

|Stage Door| constraints apply to both operational and Disabled Robots.

1. |Robots| may not |Grasp| the |Stage Door|. Violation of this rule results in
a |Major Penalty|.
2. Preventing the |Stage Door| from operating normally while an opposing |
Alliance| |Robot| attempts to travel through the |Stage Door| is not allowed.
Violation of this rule results in a |Major Penalty|. For example:
  1. |Robots| may not limit the upward motion of the |Stage Door|.
3. Transit constraints: Violations of this rule are addressed per rule <G28>.
Repeated violations will quickly escalate to a |Yellow Card| at the discretion
of the |Head Referee|.
  1. Disrupting the transit of an opposing |Alliance| |Robot| through the |Stage
  Door| is not allowed.
  2. |Robots| passing through the |Stage Door| from the audience side of the |
  Playing Field| to the back have transit priority. |Robots| traveling from the
  back of the |Playing Field| to the audience side of the |Playing Field| must
  yield a free path of travel.

> The |Stage Door| is wide enough for two |Robots| to pass through at the same
time without disruptions. |Robots| that allow a free path of travel to faster |
Robots| are less likely to incur transit constraint |Penalties|.
