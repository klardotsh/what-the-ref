# GS08: Backdrop and Backstage Constraints

1. A |Robot| may not impede or obstruct an opposing |Alliance| |Robot| that
is |In| the |Backstage| from |Scoring| a |Pixel|. Each violation of this rule
results in an immediate |Minor Penalty|.
2. |Robots| may not |Block| access to the opposing |Alliance|’s |Backstage|
or |Backdrop|. Once a referee determines this rule is being violated, a |Major
Penalty| will be applied. A |Minor Penalty| will be added for every 5 seconds
the violation continues. A |Robot| is in violation until it has moved at least 3
feet (0.9 m), approximately 1.5 |Tiles|, from the affected |Robot|(s).
3. A |Disabled| |Robot| |In| the opposing |Alliance|’s |Backstage| remains
eligible for all |Penalties| associated with <GS08>. This is an explicit
exception to rule <G07>.
4. |Robots| located |In| |Tile| rows 1, 2, or 3 may not |Score| into the |
Backstage| or |Backdrop|. Each violation will receive a |Minor Penalty|.
