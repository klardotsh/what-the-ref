# GS06: Truss Constraints

1. |Robots| may only |Grasp| one of either |Rigging| of their corresponding |
Alliance Specific| |Trusses|. Contact with the other parts of the |Truss| is
allowed for stabilization of the |Robot| while |Suspended|. The intent is that
the |Rigging| is the primary support for the |Robot|. Violation of this rule
results in zero |Score| value for the |Suspend| task.
2. |Robots| may not |Grasp| or |Suspend| from any other part of the |Truss|
structure. Violation of this rule results in a |Minor Penalty| per occurrence.
3. There is a limit of one (1) |Supported| |Robot| per |Rigging|. Additional |
Robots| |Supported| by a |Rigging| or by a |Robot| |Supported| by that |Rigging|
earn a |Major Penalty|.
4. A |Robot| may not impede or obstruct an opposing |Alliance| |Robot| from |
Suspending| during the |End Game| Period. Each violation of this rule results in
an immediate |Major Penalty| and additional |Blocking| Penalties per rule <G28>.
5. Contact with a |Suspended| opposing |Alliance| |Robot| will not invalidate
the |Suspend|. The action will also result in a |Minor Penalty| per occurrence
for contacting the |Suspended| |Robot|.
6. During the |End Game|, the height restricted paths leading to the |Rigging|
are not an open path of travel when applying rule <G28>.
