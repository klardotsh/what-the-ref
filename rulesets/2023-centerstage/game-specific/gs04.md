# GS04: Descoring

|Robots| may not descore |Pixels| or affect scoring achievements from the
opposing |Alliance|’s |Backdrop| or |Backstage|.

1. A |Minor Penalty| will be assessed for each |Pixel| that is descored.
2. An additional |Minor Penalty| is assessed for each affected completed |
Mosaic| and/or |Set Line| Bonus scoring achievement.

> Examples:
> 1. A |Robot| descores a |Pixel| from the opposing |Alliance|’s |Backdrop|.
The opposing |Alliance|’s |Mosaic| or |Set Line| points are unaffected. The
offending |Robot| that descored the |Pixel| receives one |Minor Penalty|.
> 2. A |Robot| descores a |Pixel| from the opposing |Alliance|’s |Backdrop|. The
opposing |Alliance|’s |Mosaic| score is affected by the descore. The offending |
Robot| that descored the |Pixel| receives two |Minor Penalties|.
> 3. A |Robot| repositions a |Pixel| on the opposing |Alliance|'s |Backdrop|. This
causes the affected |Alliance| to lose points for an already achieved |Set Line|
bonus. The offending |Robot| receives one |Minor Penalty|.
