# GS05: Robot Control/Possession Limits for Scoring Elements

1. |Robots| may |Control| or |Possess| a maximum of two (2) |Pixels| and one (1)
|Drone| at a time. |Controlling| or |Possessing| more than the allowed quantity
of |Scoring Elements| is an immediate |Minor Penalty| for each |Scoring Element|
above the limit plus an additional |Minor Penalty| per |Scoring Element| in
excess of the limit for each 5-second interval that the situation continues.
2. Scoring a |Pixel| while in |Control| or |Possession| of more than the allowed
quantity of |Scoring Elements| will result in a |Minor Penalty| per Element
|Scored|.
3. |Control/Possession| limit exceptions:
  1. Knocking over a stack of unscored |Pixels| is allowed.
  2. |Inadvertent| and |Inconsequential| movement of a pre-set stack of unscored
  |Pixels| is allowed. Moving the stack |Completely Off| the tape is considered
  consequential.
  3. |Plowing| through any quantity of |Scoring Elements| is allowed.
  4. |Pixels| |In| the |Backstage| that are directly |Supported| by the |
  Playing Field Floor| or |Supported| by a |Pixel| that is directly |Supported|
  by the |Playing Field Floor|, are exempt from the |Control/Possession| limit.
  The intent of this rule is to prevent penalizing a |Robot| maneuvering |In| the
  |Backstage|.
  5. |Pixels| |On| the |Backdrop| are exempt from the |Control/Possession| limit.
