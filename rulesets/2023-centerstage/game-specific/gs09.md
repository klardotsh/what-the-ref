# GS09: Wing Constraints

1. A |Robot| may not impede or obstruct an opposing |Alliance| |Robot| that is |
In| the corresponding |Alliance|’s |Wing|. Each violation of this rule results
in an immediate |Minor Penalty|.
2. |Robots| may not be |In| or |Block| access to the opposing |Alliance|’s Wing.
Once a referee determines this rule is being violated, a |Major Penalty| will
be applied. A |Minor Penalty| will be added for every 5 seconds the violation
continues. A |Robot| is in violation until it has moved at least 3 feet (0.9 m),
approximately 1.5 |Tiles|, from the |Blocked| |Wing|.
3. A |Disabled| |Robot| |In| a |Wing| is not considered a safety hazard,
therefore |Scoring Elements| may continue to be placed. However, a |Disabled|
|Robot| |In| the opposing |Alliance|’s |Wing| remains eligible for all |
Penalties| associated with <GS09> including escalation to |Yellow Cards. This is
an explicit exception to rule <G07>.
4. There can be a maximum of six (6) |Pixels| |In| the |Wing| at any one time. A
|Minor Penalty| will be assessed for each additional |Pixel| beyond the maximum.
|Pixels| in the |Possession| of a |Robot| do not count towards this limit.
