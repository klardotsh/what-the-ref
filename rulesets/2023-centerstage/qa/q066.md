# Q066: GS11.b - Inadvertent possession of another Teamâ€™s Drone.

Q: Rule <GS11>b - "A Robot may not Possess a Drone provided by another Team. A Major Penalty will be assessed for violating this rule."

Scenario: A RED alliance drone is launched during the end game and lands inside/over a BLUE alliance robot. BLUE robot is unable to shake off the RED drone. Does the BLUE alliance incur a penalty for this inadvertent, and completely out of their control, possession of RED drone?

A: No |Penalty| should be assessed for this |Inadvertent| gameplay scenario. 

The inadvertently |Possessed Drone| does not count towards the |Robot's| one (1) |Drone Control|/|Possession| limit (|GS05|.a). The |Robot| may continue normal gameplay; trying to "shake off" the stray |Drone| is not required.
