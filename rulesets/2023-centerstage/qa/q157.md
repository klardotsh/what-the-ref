# Q157: 18inch rule in terms of flexible tubing

Q: When flexible (easily bends) tubing is installed on the robot for intake, can the tubing extend slightly (1/2 inch) beyond the 18-inch boundary of the robot?

A: The maximum size of the Robot for starting a Match is 18 inches (wide by 18 inches  long by 18 inches high. However, per Rule RG02 b allows for flexible materials surgical tubing to extend up to 0.25 inches (0.635 cm) beyond the 18 inch size constraint. A 1/2" extension is outside of the allowable margin.  Consider tucking it in at startup, once the Match starts Robots may expand beyond the starting size constraint.
