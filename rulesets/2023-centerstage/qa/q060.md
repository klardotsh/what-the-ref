# Q060: <GS05> Clarification on pixel stack penalties

Q: In the third part of Q13 and in <GS05>c.ii of the game manual, it is mentioned that it is a penalty to move a stack of more than 2 white pixels off the line. My question is how many penalties would this violation cause? Would it cause multiple minor penalties for each pixel more than 2 on the stack, (Ex. 3 penalties for moving a stack of 5), or just one minor penalty for the entire stack moving?

A: Rule GS05.a is restated here with the answer to your question highlighted with bold formatting: "|Robots| may |Control| or |Possess| a maximum of two (2) |Pixels| and one (1) |Drone| at a time. |Controlling| or |Possessing| more than the allowed quantity of |Scoring Elements| is an immediate |Minor Penalty| ||for each |Scoring Element| above the limit|| plus an additional |Minor Penalty| per |Scoring Element| in excess of the limit for each 5-second interval that the situation continues."

If the |Robot| does not |Control| any |Pixels| just before it moves the |Pixel| stack |Off| the white tape line, the number of |Minor Penalties| is the quantity of |Pixels| in the stack minus two (2).  For example, if there are five (5) |Pixels| in the stack, the |Penalty| is three (3) |Minor Penalties| for |Controlling| three (3) |Pixels| above the allowed quantity of two (2). If the |Robot| continues to |Control| more than the allowed quantity of |Pixels|, an additional |Minor Penalty| for each |Pixel| over the allowed quantity of two (2) will be assessed every five (5) seconds that the |Robot| |Controls| more than two (2) |Pixels|.
