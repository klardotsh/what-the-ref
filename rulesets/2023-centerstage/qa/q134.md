# Q134: Stacking Pixels on Spike Marks

Q: May the robot place a pixel on top of another pixel on the designated spike mark for both pixels to score?

A: The answer that you seek is found by reading the |Randomization Task| description in section 4.4.2 of Game Manual Part 2.

No, the |Pre-Load|ed purple |Pixel| is the only |Pixel| that is eligible to earn the |Spike Mark| |Randomization Task| points. All other |Pixels| on the |Spike Mark| have zero |Score| value.

||Note:|| A purple |Pixel| |On| another |Pixel| or |Team Prop| that is located |On| the |Spike Mark| is eligible to earn points for the |Spike Mark| |Randomization Task|.
