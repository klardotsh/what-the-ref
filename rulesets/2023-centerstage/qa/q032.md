# Q032: What exactly is considered autonomous interference?

Q: Consider these scenarios: Q1: A robot places a pixel in the opposing alliance's half of the playing field and the pixel disrupts an opposing alliance's robot. Q2: A robot knocks over the pixel stacks on the opposing alliance's half of the playing field and their robot is no longer able to pick them up in autonomous. Q3: Are any of these scenarios considered interference as long as my bot doesn't touch their bot or interfere with the randomization task scoring?

A: A1: This scenario violates the |Autonomous Interference| rule, |GS03|. 

A2: Knocking over a |Pixel| stack in the opposing |Alliance's| half of the |Playing Field| that affects an opposing |Alliance Robot| during the |Autonomous Period|, violates rule |GS03|.

A3: Yes, both of the scenarios in this question thread violate rule |GS03|, even though there is no direct |Robot| to |Robot| contact.

||Note||: These are great questions that may lead to the Game Design Committee adding clarifying text to the |Autonomous Period Interference| rule, |GS03|, in a future release of the Game Manual Part 2. For now, per the text in section 4.5 of Game Manual Part 2, the answers in this question thread take precedence over all information in the game manuals.
