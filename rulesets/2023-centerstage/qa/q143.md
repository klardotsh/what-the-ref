# Q143: Energy source/storage by spring-like mechanisms or rubber bands clarification

Q: When RG05 says be careful in the stored energy from spring-like or other mechanisms, Is it then a fair assumption that it is ok to deform a rubber band, spring device, or surgical tubing in a way that stores energy prior to the start of the match. Our intent would be to store energy for the purpose of launching the drone.

A: Yes, rubber bands, springs, etc. are all acceptable methods for launching a |Drone|. The intent of RG05 is not to eliminate stored energy devices but to ensure that teams use them safely.  Remember that during a match FTA's may have to access your robot and we don't want anyone hurt if the energy is accidentally released.
