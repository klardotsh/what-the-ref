# Q114: Eligibility for Advancement

Q: If there is a team competing in a region other than its home region, it cannot qualify for the World Championship, but if a team from the home region allies with it and they win the final match, does this qualify it to qualify for the World Championship instead?

A: If a team is part of the winning alliance at an event outside of their home region, this does not qualify the team for advancement. The advancement spots available would skip over the out of home region team to the next eligible advancing team within the home region.
