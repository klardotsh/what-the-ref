# Q132: How to set camera exposure

Q: How do you use the ExposureControl classes with the Camera now that Vuforia has been removed from the Library?

A: This is not a rule clarification question, but a technical support question. As such, this question should be asked on the [FTC-Community forums](https://ftc-community.firstinspires.org) where the FIRST Tech Challenge engineering staff and community members are ready to take your questions.
