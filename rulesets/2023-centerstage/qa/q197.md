# Q197: Are team logos considered fiducial markers?

Q: Our team logo is a pair of eyes.  Are we allowed to embed our logo into a 3D-printed team prop?

A: Based on the feedback we have received from Teams and volunteers we are clarifying and relaxing the restrictions on the types of images that are allowed on the Team Prop. The intent of rule TE03b is:
1.	prevent the use of any object on the field that could confuse or distract other Robots.
2.	prevent the use of canned solutions to simplify the task of object identification.

Therefore, any image that resembles a QR code, AprilTag, or coded vision target is not allowed.  All other images such as team logos, sponsor logos, raised areas, cut outs, etc. are allowed, providing no other rule is violated.
