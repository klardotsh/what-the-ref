# Q056: Are optic flow sensors considered image sensors?

Q: Would a optic flow sensor considered as an image sensor as in the definition of the Vision Camera and Visions Sensor?

A: An optic flow sensor usually combines a camera, distance sensor (sonar or lidar are most common), and sometimes an IMU. This type of device uses these component sensors to make decisions and provides outputs that can be read/used by a control system - this is the very definition of a Vision Sensor as defined by Game Manual 1.  Just be sure the device does not violate any Vision Sensor rules in RE13.b, and also ensure that none of the component sensors violate any rules such as RE12.c in the case of optic flow sensors containing lasers (such as lidar sensors).
