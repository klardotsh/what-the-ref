# Q077: Can a Team Prop have retroreflective tape as part of its construction?

Q: TE02 specifies the Team Prop must be Red or Blue. TE03 disallows fiducial markers. Can a Team Prop incorporate red- or blue-colored retroreflective tape in its construction, or does that count as a fiducial marker?

A: Per Rule TE03, a Team Prop may not have any retroreflective materials.
