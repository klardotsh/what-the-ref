# Q156: Are Tile interlocking tabs considered in?

Q: Do the interlocking teeth on the edge of a foam tile count as part of the tile for the purposes of starting location (i.e, if a robots wheel is on the jagged edge of a tile, would they be considered "Completely In Tile")?

A: No, a |Robot| that is |In| a |Tile|'s interlocking teeth is |In| more than one |Tile|. The Pre-Match |Robot| set up requirement is that the |Robot| is |Completely In| only one (1) of the required |Tile|s. See section 4.4.1 item #3 in Game Manual Part 2 for all of the Pre-Match |Robot| set up requirements.
