# Q035: Drone Placement in the Wing

Q: Q1: A human player can not be in the wing, if a robot is in the wing. Correct?

Q2: If a drone is not pre-loaded on the robot before the match, it can be placed in the wing by the human player. Does the robot have to load the drone itself? I'm assuming that it could not be done by the human player.

A: A1: Yes, this is a correct statement. See rule GS12 to learn all of the |Human Player| constraints.

A2: Yes, the |Robot| would need to load the |Drone| itself without human assistance per rule GS12.h.
