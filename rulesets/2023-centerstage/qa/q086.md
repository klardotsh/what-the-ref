# Q086: Placing Pixels On either Backdrop

Q: Q1: Provided no rules are violated, during the Driver-Controlled period may a robot place Pixels On either Alliance's Backdrop during gameplay? Q2: For example, during Driver-Controlled, may a Robot on the Blue Alliance places a Pixel On the Red Alliance's Backdrop?

A: A1: No, placing a |Pixel On| the opposing |Alliance's Backdrop| violates rule G29 for amplifying the difficulty of creating a |Mosaic|.  

A2: No, per A1.


||Note:|| The |Drive Team| needs to be careful not to violate rules G28 (|Pinning|, |Trapping|, and |Blocking|), GS04 (descoring), and GS08 (|Backdrop| and |Backstage| constraints) while their |Robot| is near the opposing |Alliance's Backdrop| and |Backstage|.
