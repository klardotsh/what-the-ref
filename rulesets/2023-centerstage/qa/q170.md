# Q170: Intaking the bottom two pixels off the pixel stack

Q: Our intake uses two spinning wheels to suck pixels off the mat and into our robot.  Q1: During autonomous can our intake suck in the bottom two pixels off the stack of 5 pixels (on our alliance side) leaving the top 3 to fall wherever including off the white line without getting a penalty?  Q2: During driver-control can we do the same thing without getting a penalty?

A: The answers that you seek are found by reading rule GS05.c in Game Manual Part 2.

A1: Yes, subject to the constraints specified in rule GS05; the three (3) |Pixels| that are not |Possessed| by the |Robot| must be: a) no longer stacked (i.e., knocked over); or b) stacked |On| the white tape line.

A2: Same answer as A1.
