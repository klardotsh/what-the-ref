# Q205: During autonomous, can a total of 25 pts be earned w/ a purple pixel (Tape + Backdrop) ?

Q: During autonomous play, after earning 20 points by placing a purple pixel next to the Team Prop on the Spike Tape, can the purple pixel be picked up and placed on the backdrop for an additional 5 points?

A: The answer that you seek is found by reading section 4.4.2 and the definition of "|Scored at Rest|" in Game Manual Part 2.

No, the |Autonomous Period Scoring| achievements are "|Scored at Rest|" (i.e., when the entire field has come to rest after the end of the |Autonomous Period|). The |Score| value of the purple |Pixel| is determined based on its location at the end of the |Autonomous Period|.
