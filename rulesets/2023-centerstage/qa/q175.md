# Q175: Suspending prior to end game

Q: A robot begins to suspend before the start of the end game period. The drive team realizes their error, returns their robot to the ground and then begins and completes their suspend during the end game portion of the match. How is this scenario scored?

A: The consequence for starting the |Suspension| task early is described in Section 4.4.4 in Game Manual Part 2: "|End Game| achievements, other than |Navigating|, begun before the start of |End Game| are worth zero (0) points". 

The |Robot| in this scenario may regain its eligibility for the |Suspension| task by lowering itself to the |Playing Field Floor| and disengaging from the |Rigging|. 

||Note:|| Disengaging from the |Rigging| must be obvious and unambiguous.
