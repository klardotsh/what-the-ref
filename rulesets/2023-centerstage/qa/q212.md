# Q212: Team Numbers and definition of height

Q: <TE05> b) The Team number may be no more than 0.5 inches (1.27 cm) in height.

The formal definition of height is:  the distance from the bottom to the top of something, the distance upward from a given level to a fixed point, or something measured vertically.

Is a 3D-printed cylinder with numbers raised by ~0.25" on the top face be considered legal height for TE05 subrule (b) where a box of dims ~0.75" x ~2.0" would enclose the numbers as viewed from above?

A: Rule TE05 b refers to the height of the text from the bottom edge of the number to the top edge of the number as viewed perpendicular to the text. The rule does not restrict the distance that a number is extruded from a surface. When viewed from above, the numbers must fit into a box no larger than .5" height. The length of the box is dependent on the number of digits in your team number and is not restricted.
