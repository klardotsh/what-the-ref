# Q059: Vision Camera Questions

Q: We are a rookie team so we want to know how many vision cameras are allowed to use this year (one other team told us that only one vision camera can be used). Also are Pixy or Pixy2 Cam allowed?

A: 1. Welcome to |FIRST| Tech Challenge! 

2. There are no rules that specify a maximum quantity on sensors, Vision Cameras, or Vision Sensors.

3. The Pixy and Pixy2 are Vision Sensors, the Pixy2 is specifically called out as a common Vision Sensor in the definition of a Vision Sensor. Note that the Pixy and Pixy2 do not have native software support in SDK 9.0, so teams will need to develop their own software drivers to use them.
