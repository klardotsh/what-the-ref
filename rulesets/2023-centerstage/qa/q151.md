# Q151: Interference while launching a drone

Q: The rules state that a team may not interfere with the opposing alliance's drone while in flight and the result is the launching team gets 30 points.  What happens if an opponent bumps a robot that is in the process of launching  (and altering the path of the drone) without actually touching the drone?

A: The gameplay described in the question is not allowed per rule GS11.g.iii. |Drive Teams| may not directly or indirectly affect the flight of a |Drone|. The |Robot| in this scenario is under control of the |Drive Team| during all valid |Drone| launching times, |Robot| interactions that affect |Drone| flight are controlled by the |Drive Teams| yielding indirect |Interference|.
