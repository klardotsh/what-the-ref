# Q167: In alliance's wing during autonomous

Q: During autonomous we want to pass between the spike mark and the wall; however, we move through the opposing alliance's wing. Rule GS09 states that it is a major penalty but does that apply to autonomous?

A: A |Robot| moving through the opposing |Alliance's Wing| during the |Autonomous Period| should be excused from violating rule GS09 per rule G10.

||Note:|| The first action for a |Robot| that is |In| or |Blocking| access to the opposing |Alliance's Wing| at the start of the |Driver-Controlled Period| should be to immediately move away per rule GS09.
