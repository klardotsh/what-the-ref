# Q071: REV grounding strap wiring constraints?

Q: Reading RE14.k, it seems that the only legal connection points for a REV Grounding Strap are the female XT30 ports of a Control Hub, Expansion Hub, XT30 Power Distribution Block, or the female XT30 on a REV PowerPole to XT30 adapter. Q1: Is this an accurate conclusion? Q2: Does the "No other...adapters are permitted" portion of RE14.k also apply to electrical connections "upstream" (towards the Main Power Switch) of the CH/EH/PDB/PP component the grounding strap is connected to?

A: Answer 1: RE14k requires that the REV Grounding Strap be directly connected to a fully-COTS component with XT30 connectors (includes the REV provided XT30/Powerpole adapter).  It may not be connected to team manufactured wiring.

Answer 2: No. Teams are allowed to wire their robot as needed as long as the wiring does not violate any of the provisions of RE14.
