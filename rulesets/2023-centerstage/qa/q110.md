# Q110: Can Team number on Team Prop be printed on white background?

Q: Game Manual 1 says Team Prop has to be of solid color of red or blue, except for Team number.  So is it ok we print team number on a piece of white paper then stick it onto the team prop?

A: No, the only non-alliance color on the Team Prop can be the numbers themselves.
