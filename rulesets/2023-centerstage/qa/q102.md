# Q102: Legality of modifying COTS Circuits

Q: As per Game Manual Part I, "Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) interface modules designed to solely control light sources are allowed between the light sources and the components listed in <RE12>d"
Our team wishes to modify a REV Digital LED Indicator to change the color of the LED diodes as to avoid creating a "custom circuit" (RE16). As this is not listed as either an allowed or disallowed modification in RE15, are we allowed to do this, if the replacement diode is of a similar spec?

A: This type of modification is not allowed.  This would constitute an internal modification of the circuits in the LED indicator and is not allowed per RE15
