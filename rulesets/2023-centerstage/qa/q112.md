# Q112: Knocking pixels off the stack scenarios

Q: Clarification about knocking pixels off the stack.  Q1: Autonomous - Is there a penalty if a robot knock pixels off own Alliance's stack while picking them, as long as the knocked-over pixels do not interfere with the opposing Alliance robot.  Q2: Driver Control Period - Is there a penalty for ramming into own or opposing Alliance's pixel stack (to knock them over) and then picking up 2 pixels.

A: A1: No |Penalty| per rule GS05.c.i. A rule GS03.c |Penalty| does not apply because the scenario description stated that the knocked over |Pixels| do not interfere with an opposing |Alliance Robot|.

A2: No |Penalty| per rule GS05.c.i., provided that no other rules are violated. For example, |Pixels| may not be |Propelled| per rule GS10.

||Note:|| All |Pixel| stacks are |Alliance Neutral| during the |Driver-Controlled Period|.
