# Q138: Follow Up to Q130

Q: We wanted to confirm that the answer to 2) is a change from last yearâ€™s response, which said stalling was allowed. For clarification, we wanted to pose another case: during initialization (both during inspection & pre-game) could we have the motors that power our lift move so that the lift is raised to a specific height? In this instance, the motor is not stalling: it is running to a position and then holding that position, the same way a servo holds its position while the robot is initialized.

A: Motors and servos "hold position" very differently. Motors with a load applied to their motor shaft can "hold position" through mechanical friction (via a gearbox/gear train) or through stalling. Servos with a load applied to their splines generally only "hold position" through stalling. If the motor can "hold position" even when power is no longer being applied to the motor, then that is legal. If power must be applied to the motor to hold position, it's not legal.
