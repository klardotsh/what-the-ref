# Q171: Can a Silver Sharpie be used to add the team number to the drone?

Q: Sharpie offers 2 types of silver pens (1) Sharpie Oil-based Paint Marker and (2) Sharpie Permanent Marker. I believe that the paint marker is not allowed and that the permanent marker is allowed. Can you state if either are legal per <DR05>?

A: A1:Per Rule DR05b, the oil-based paint version of the Sharpie is not allowed.  
A2: The standard Sharpie Permanent Marker is legal. 

Remember, the reason for requiring a Team Number is so that Drones can be returned to the Teams post Match.  Any attempt to "game the rules" by adding weight by the use of excess ink or other marking materials will result in the Drone being disallowed.
