# Q122: Does the drone have to be red or blue?

Q: <DR05> states that we may use a color printer to achieve the required red and blue colors.  I know the drone has to have the team number to be easily identifiable, but does it have to be colored to match our alliance color?

A: Rule DR03 states that "The predominant color of a |Drone| must match the Teamâ€™s assigned Alliance color for the Match (red or blue)".
