# Q044: Backdrop scoring and restriction in Autonomous.

Q: Q1: Do both teams in an alliance get to have their own team prop on each side of the truss?
Q2: May both teams on an alliance put pixels on the backdrop and score? That way we have two yellow pixels on the backdrop by end of autonomous.
Q3: Is there any way an alliance can put more colored pixels on the backdrop during the autonomous period?

A: A1: Yes, see section 4.4.1 item 3.d in Game Manual Part 2 for how to place a |Team Prop| on the |Playing Field| during pre-|Match| set up.

A2: Yes.

A3: Each |Drive Team| may |Pre-Load| exactly one (1) yellow |Pixel| and one (1) purple |Pixel| during pre-|Match| set up as described in section 4.4.1 item 3.b in Game Manual Part 2. This is the only way non-white colored |Pixels| enter the |Playing Field| for use during the |Autonomous Period|. 

A highly unlikely, legal way for a |Robot| to access an additional non-white |Pixel| would be by picking up a stray non-white |Pixel| located |In| its |Alliance's| half of the |Playing Field|. Keep in mind that |Robots| may only use its own |Pre-Loaded Pixels| to earn |Randomization Task| points per  section 4.4.2 item 2.b in Game Manual Part 2.
