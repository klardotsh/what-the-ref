# Q084: Which previous seasons are disallowed by <RM06> part b?

Q: <RM06> b. says "The following season game and scoring elements are not allowed for Robot construction: ... Team manufactured replicas of COTS current or previous season’s scoring elements." Is the intended meaning of "previous season’s scoring elements" to be "scoring elements of previous season" i.e. prohibiting just POWERPLAY replicas, or (if we reposition the apostrophe) "previous seasons' scoring elements" as in "scoring elements of [ALL] previous seasons"?

A: Rule RM06 should be interpreted as referring to only the previous season's game and scoring elements, which for Centerstage means any of the Power Play  game and scoring elements.
