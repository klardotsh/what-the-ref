# Q140: Team Numbers on Team Prop

Q: I see that in <TE05> b &c, team numbers must be no more than 0.5 inch in height. and may only appear on the team prop one time. It looks like this rule may apply to team numbers that are on the team prop in a color other than red or blue.  If the team has designed & 3D printed a team prop that includes their team number as a part of the 3D print (i.e. completely red or blue 3D printed material), and the team number is larger than 0.5 and/or appears more than one time, would that be acceptable?

A: 3D printed numbers must follow the same rules as any other method. Therefore, a Team Prop that includes their team number as part of the 3D print and is larger than .5 inch or appears more than once is not allowed.
