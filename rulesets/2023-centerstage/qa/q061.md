# Q061: Penalty Point Values

Q: After text searches through GM1 and GM2, I have been unable to find point values for penalties in this year's game. What are the point values for minor and major penalties respectively?

A: The answer that you seek is found by reading the "|Penalties|" section 4.4.6 in Game Manual Part 2.

Section 4.4.6 states in part: "|Minor Penalties| give the non-offending |Alliance| ten (10) points per occurrence. |Major Penalties| give the non-offending |Alliance| thirty (30) points per occurrence."
