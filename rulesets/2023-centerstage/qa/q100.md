# Q100: Is this a legal drone?

Q: Is this a legal drone design (assuming it was the correct team color had a team number on it)? It follows a non-ballistic trajectory and has a fuselage and 4 wings (<DR02>).

A: No, this is not legal for several reasons. It does not look like a "paper airplane", it does not follow a glide path, and it has 4 fins not wings.
