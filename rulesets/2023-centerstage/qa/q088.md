# Q088: Indirect Penalties

Q: Rule G03 only mentions the case where an alliance forces another alliance to break a rule, but does not receive a penalty. Q1: What happens, for example, if a RED robot pushes/bumps a BLUE robot into the BLUE Backdrop, causing pixels to be descored? Does the RED robot receive penalties as if it were the one to directly descore the pixels? Q2: If the answer to Q1 is that the RED robot will receive penalties, how will it be determined if the RED robot's actions are enough to warrant a penalty?

A: A1: Yes, the red |Alliance| will receive one |Minor Penalty| for each affected |Pixel|, completed |Mosaic|, and |Set Bonus|. For example, descoring two |Pixels| that are part of a completed |Mosaic| and a |Set Bonus| achievement. Receive four |Minor Penalties| as described below:

a) Two (2) descored |Pixels| =  Two (2) |Minor Penalties|.

b) Two (2) |Pixels| from the same |Mosaic| = One (1) |Minor Penalty|.

c) One (1) or two (2) |Pixels| eliminating one (1) |Set Line| achievement = One (1) |Minor Penalty|.

A2: Any direct |Robot| contact initiated by the red |Alliance Robot| should be penalized if |Pixels| are descored. Maneuvering close to an opposing |Alliance Robot| that is close to their |Alliance's Backdrop| and/or |Backstage| is a risky gameplay strategy that does not have an obvious strategic gameplay advantage other than to disrupt the opposing |Alliance Robot|. In the scenario described in the question, the referee should penalize the red |Alliance Robot| for violating the descoring rule GS04.
