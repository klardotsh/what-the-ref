# Q038: Rigging suspension and robot weight

Q: Our team was discussing the rigging suspension task and thinking about years past about how there was a weight limit for suspending. Q1: Is there going to be an update to a weight limit? Q2: If not, what is the ruling if a pole bends or brakes due to robot weight?

A: A1: No, we feel that the |Truss| and |Rigging| will be able to withstand a "maximum" weight |Robot|. |Robot| weight was a major consideration when designing the |Truss| structure and writing the |Truss| constraints rule, GS06.

A2: Rule S01 in Game Manual Part 2 describes the consequences for |Playing Field| damage. Some bending of the |Rigging| is expected while a |Robot| is |Suspended|. No |Penalty| will be administered if the |Rigging| returns to its nominal shape in time for the next |Match| on that |Playing Field|.
