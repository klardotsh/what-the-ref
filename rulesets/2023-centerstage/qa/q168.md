# Q168: Pre-placed white pixels

Q: Rule GS03.c is applicable to pre-stacked white pixels in the opposing alliance half of the playing field. Q1: Is the opposing alliance stack close to their wing / human player or is it the stack closest to their spike marks? Q2: During the driver-controlled period can a robot knock over the pre-placed white pixels in the opposing alliances half of the playing field? Q3: during autonomous can the robot knock over the pre-placed white pixels closest to our spike marks?

A: A1: The answer that you seek is found by reading rule GS03.a. Rule GS03.a states in part: "|Tiles| A, B, C constitute the blue side of the |Playing Field|, |Tiles| D, E, F constitute the red side of the |Playing Field|." |Tile| location nomenclature is described in Game Manual Part 2 Appendix B. Therefore, each |Alliance's| half of the |Playing Field| contains three (3) |Pixel Stacks|.

The |Pixel Stacks| in |Tiles| B1, B1/C1, and C1 are on the blue |Alliance's| half of the |Playing Field|. |Pixel Stacks| in |Tiles| D1, D1/E1, and E1 are on the red |Alliance's| half of the |Playing Field|.
