# Q190: Double Pixel Claw

Q: We have a claw design that can grab 2 pixels at once from a stack in autonomous. If the claw grabs the top and bottom pixel, then rotates which dumps out the middle 3 pixels, is that legal, or is that considered possessing/controlling? The robot is not, otherwise, moving.

A: The |Robot| is |Controlling| five (5) |Pixels|, a violation of rule GS05.a.
