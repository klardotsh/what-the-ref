# Q042: Pixel moving which is on the floor and not used by alliance.

Q: Action 1. Red alliance robot picks up a pixel from their side of the field.
Action 2. Moving it towards their backdrop/backstage, they drop the pixel outside a scoring area in the blue alliance side of field, while on the way.

Q1: Can a blue alliance robot pickup the pixel and use it for their advantage?

Q2: This is not autonomous interference? 

Q3: Does it incur any penalty?

A: A1: Yes. During the |Autonomous Period| it is a non-scored |Pixel| located in their |Alliance's| half of the |Playing Field|. During the |Driver-Controlled Period| it is available to a |Robot| on any |Alliance| because it is not |In| a |Scoring Area| or |Wing|, provided that no other rule is violated (for example, GS05 and GS08 to name a few).

Keep in mind that during the |Autonomous Period|, |Robots| may only use its own |Pre-Loaded Pixels| to earn |Randomization Task| points per section 4.4.2 item 2.b in Game Manual Part 2.

A2: The red |Alliance| violates rule GS03 each time the dropped |Pixel| disrupts a blue |Alliance Robot| during the |Autonomous Period| or if the red |Alliance Robot| directly |Interferes| with an opposing |Alliance Robot| that is in its own |Alliance's| half of the |Playing Field|. The blue |Alliance Robots| are not at risk for violating the |Autonomous Interference| rule, provided that they remain on their |Alliance's| half of the |Playing Field|.

A3: See A2.
