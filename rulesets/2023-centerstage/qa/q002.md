# Q002: Spitting out a third pixel

Q: Per rule |GS05| |robots| canâ€™t |possess|/|control| more than 2 |pixels|, and doing so results in a |minor penalty| for each additional |pixel| as well as another |minor penalty| after every 5 seconds.

Q1: We were wondering if there is an exception to be made for intaking a 3rd |pixel| and immediately spitting it back out.

Q2: Additionally, if such an exception is the case, are there limitations on our actions while the 3rd |pixel| is in our possession/control? (ex. driving)

A: A1: Yes there is an exception. The |Robot| in this scenario is unlikely to be |Penalized| for |Controlling| too many |Pixels|. The referee should view the |Robot's| actions as being both |Inadvertent| and |Inconsequential| and not call a rule |GS05| |Penalty| as allowed by rule |G10|.

A2: Yes, for this scenario, there are limitations to being excused for a rule |GS05| |Penalty|. The |Robot| is unlikely to receive a rule |GS05| |Penalty| if the |Robot| satisfies the following two conditions: 1) It ejects the extra |Pixel| in a reasonable amount of time and; 2) It refrains from playing the game while |Controlling| the extra |Pixel|. Two examples of playing the game are: a) Traveling to a different location and; b) Placing a |Pixel In| a |Scoring Area|. If the |Robot's| actions are clearly focused on removing the extra |Pixel| and not playing other aspects of the game, it is highly unlikely that it will receive a |GS05| |Penalty|.
