# Q063: How enclosed can the hexagons be in the robot?

Q: How enclosed can the pixels be in the robot? Meaning, do the refs have to see the pixels at all times or can they go into the robot?

A: Yes, |Pixels| can be in the |robot|.  However, once inside the |Robot| it is to a team's advantage to keep the |Pixel|s visible so that it is easy for the Ref to determine the quantity of |Pixel|s that a |Robot| is carrying, but it is not a requirement.
