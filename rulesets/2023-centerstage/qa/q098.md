# Q098: Using Motorola phone as a camera sensor with a Control Hub

Q: Are we allowed to use a Motorola phone as a camera sensor connected to a Rev Robotics Control Hub in order to have a video processing stream as opposed to a frame by frame processing stream.  We do not want to use the FTC app on the phone as a secondary control hub.

A: The short answer is no.

This type of phone usage would need to fit into either a Vision Sensor model or a Vision Camera model.

RE11.a requires that sensors (including vision sensors) be connected only to I2C, digital I/O, encoder, or analog ports of the REV control or expansion hubs. A USB port is not a valid connection for a sensor. The usage is therefore not a Vision Sensor usage

RE16 disallows additional electronics.  Using a phone in the above described fashion is creating a user-programmable device and falls under the guidance of RE16. Vision Cameras cannot be user-programmable devices.
