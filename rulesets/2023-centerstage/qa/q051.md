# Q051: Train Model Button Disabled

Q: I have followed all the steps in the Machine Learning Tutorial Tool Chain and whenever I generate a data set, if I try to train it the start training button does not become active. This is the same issue as described in Q17 but the response to that question does not solve the problem. I have already contacted customer support at FIRST a week ago with no resolution.

A: This is a technical support question, not a game-specific rules clarification. If the issue persists, please seek help on the [ftc-community](https://ftc-community.firstinspires.org/) forums. The FIRST Tech Challenge engineering staff is monitoring those forums, and await your questions.
