# Q069: Can we power sensors connected to the analog, digital, and i2c  port from 5v aux port?

Q: Past interpretation of the prior version of RE11.a allowed for many 5v in, 3.3v out sensors to be connected to the aux 5v port. The new RE11.a seems to clarify where sensors can be connected, but was it intentional to outlaw use of the 5v aux port to power them even though they are otherwise connected to the analog, digital, and i2c ports for all but power? The aux port is used to power other sensor port devices, like I2C lights (see Q27)

A: No.  Sensors may only be powered via the ports listed in RE11.a.  If your sensor needs 5v, you will need to utilize the REV Logic Level Converter as described in RE11.b
