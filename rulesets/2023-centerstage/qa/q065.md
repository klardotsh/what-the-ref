# Q065: GS11.g.i - Tall robots being hit by opposing alliance drone near the audience side wall

Q: Rule GS11>g.i states - "Affecting the flight of an opposing Alliances Drone above Playing Field Wall.... Opposing Alliance Drone receives points for Landing Zone 1."
Scenario: A tall RED robot parks itself right along the audience side perimeter wall, during the game play. A BLUE drone hits it during end game and falls into the playing field instead of landing/falling into zone 1/2/3. RED team had no way of knowing the BLUE drone trajectory. Is this scenario a violation of <GS11>g.i?

A: Yes, the red |Alliance Robot| in this scenario violates rule GS11.g.i.

When a |Drone| contacts an opposing |Alliance Robot| that is actively playing the game in the front half (audience side) of the |Playing Field|, the referee may use their judgement to decide if it was allowed gameplay or if a rule GS11.g.i violation |Warning| or |Penalty|  should be applied.

In the scenario described in the question, the |Parked Robot| is not actively playing the game and is likely to be viewed by the referee as   a strategy to interfere with a |Drone's| flightpath.

The following are a few examples of active gameplay that are unlikely to be viewed as violating rule GS11.g.i if the |Robot| contacts an opposing |Alliance Drone|.

a) A |Robot| driving from their |Alliance's Wing| along an approximate direct path through the |Truss| or |Stage Door| towards their |Backstage| area.

b) A |Robot| returning from their |Backstage| area along an approximate direct path through the |Truss| or |Stage Door| towards their |Alliance's Wing|.

c) A |Robot| preparing to |Suspend|.

d) A |Suspended Robot|.

Example scenarios where the referee is likely to issue a rule GS11.g.i |Warning| or |Penalty| are:

e) A |Robot| moving around the front half (audience size) of the |Playing Field| without an obvious |Scoring Element| collection, transportation, or |Scoring| purpose.

f) A |Robot Parked| in the front half (audience) side of the |Playing Field|.

||Note:|| |Robots| have an obligation during the |End Game| to avoid gameplay strategies that interfere with an opposing |Alliance Drone's| trajectory. Similarly, a |Robot Launching| a |Drone| may not use rule GS11.g protections as a strategy to receive |Landing Zone 1| points.
