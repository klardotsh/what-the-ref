# Q201: Clarification on stack movement penalties.

Q: Given no other rule violations, should these result in a pixel control penalty:

Q1: Plowing over the pre-stacked pixels in driver-controlled?

Q2: Plowing over the pre-stacked pixels on the corresponding alliance's side in autonomous?

A: We believe !Q13, !Q112, and !Q168 answers your question. If they do not, please rephrase your question and resubmit.


A1: No penalty, per rule GS05.c.i.

A2: No penalty, per rule GS05.c.i.
