# Q085: Are ethernet cables allowed for cable management?

Q: We have some questions about using an (coiled) CAT 6 ethernet cable to power multiple servos, so we don't need cable extensions, since it is within spec of CAT 6. Could you please clarify if this is allowed, and if so, under what circumstances:

  a) Is it allowed to cut the ethernet cable and solder servo mounts to it?
  b) Can we use a keystone, so you don't need to cut the cable?
  c) Create a custom PCB connecting an RJ45 connector to multiple servo connectors? (With appropriate insulation)

A: In general, bundled cables could be legal, as long as the individual wires within the bundle meet the requirements of RE14.i as applied to the specific connection being extended.

Be aware that typical CAT6 cables use 23 AWG, thinner than the minimum required for servo interconnections (22 AWG).

If you do end up utilizing bundled cables, be prepared to show documentation for the specifications of bundle and the specific circuits/interconnections made through the bundle.

For your other questions:

| a) attaching connectors to allowed wiring is permitted per RE14.e 
| b) keystone connectors fall under RE14.e as well 
| c) no. a PCB would be an example of a custom circuit and disallowed per RE16
