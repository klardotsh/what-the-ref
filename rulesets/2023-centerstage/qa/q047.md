# Q047: Moving pixels from spike marks

Q: Q1: If the purple pixel is placed on the spike mark in the scoring position, but due to movement of robots doing other tasks, if it moves the pixel from the spike mark (alliance robot or opponent robot), how does the scoring work?

Q2: If the achievement score is determined right after autonomous, in the driver-controlled period, can we use that spike mark pixel for badkrop/backstage scoring purpose?

A: A1: |Autonomous Period| tasks are |Scored at Rest| per section 4.4.2 in Game Manual Part 2. "|Scored at Rest|" is defined in section 4.3 in Game Manual Part 2.  Applying the definition to the |Pixel| placed on the |Spike Mark|, the |Pixel| is considered to be |Scored| if it is |On| the designated (correct) |Spike Mark| when the entire field has come to rest after the |Autonomous Period| ends. 

In the Q1 scenario, the purple |Pixel| is not |On| the correct |Spike Mark|, therefore, the |Pixel's Score| value is zero.

There is no |Penalty| if a |Robot| descores its own |Alliance's Pixel|. Rule GS03 is violated If an opposing |Alliance Robot| descores the |Spike Mark Pixel|.

A2: Yes.
