# Q041: Non-Ballistic Trajectory

Q: Q1: How will Robot Inspectors define non-ballistic trajectory (from <DR02>)?

Q2: From Q21: How will Referees define "near ballistic trajectory"?

A: A1: |Robot| Inspectors will evaluate compliance with rule DR02 by focusing on the |Drone| having the general configuration of an airplane with a defined fuselage and wings. A guide to assist |Teams| and |Robot| Inspectors with evaluating |Drone| designs will be published soon on the [Volunteer Resources](https://www.firstinspires.org/node/5146) webpage.

|Robot| Inspectors are not expected to validate the non-ballistic quality of |Drone| flight. When asked by a referee, a |Robot| Inspector will verify that the |Drone's| trajectory used in gameplay complies with rule RG07 in Game Manual Part 1. The typical setup for verifying rule RG07 compliance is described in the answer to !Q30.

A2: Referees will focus on: a) Compliance with the |Drone| constraints rule |GS10| and; b) |Drone| trajectory height and distance compliance with rule RG07. The ballistic characteristics of the |Drone's| trajectory is not a gameplay metric for the referee.
