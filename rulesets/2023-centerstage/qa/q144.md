# Q144: Landing Zone In Venues

Q: We host in a venue with a stage. The stage is slightly larger than the Playing Field Floor. The Landing Zone will cause us difficulties in hosting. Does the Landing Zone have to be a flat ground or could we erect nets that are placed with PVC pipe at the correct distances. For instance, at 24" there would be a net with the top level with the field. This would allow the Drone to hit it and fall down in the correct zone. Or is it required we build an extension to the stage for the landing zone?

A: The use of nets, either vertically or horizontally placed, would go against the intent of the challenge. 
1. Vertical nets would trap/capture drones inside a landing zone.
2. Horizontal nets allow the drones to be "caught" in the net.

An option would be to look over the venue layout and decide if the stage is the best option for the field, or if there may be a better space within the venue to accommodate the landing zones without the need to build an extension. If not, an extension off the stage may be built to accommodate the landing zones. We recommend placing field personnel (not referees) near the locations where stage and the extension zone meet so that no one walks on the extension. Stanchions or another deterrent from the audience approaching the landing zones should be a consideration to ensure audience members are not accidentally hit with launched drones.
