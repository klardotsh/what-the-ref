# Q003: GS06 Rigging clarification

Q: Q1: Are the yellow tubes on the truss considered rigging or just the red / blue tubes?
Q2: The rule <GS06> states: “There is a limit of one (1) Supported Robot per Rigging.”  Is this per tube, or the entire Truss? Q3: Asked another way, is it possible for two alliance robots to hang from the Truss - each on a different alliance colored tube?

A: A1: The red and blue pipes are the |Rigging|. The yellow pipes are not |Rigging|. See illustration C-4 in Appendix C of Game Manual Part 2.

A2: The rule GS06.c limitation is per tube. There are four (4) |Alliance Specific Riggings|, two (2) red and two (2) blue as stated in the definition of |Rigging| in the game definitions section (4.3) of Game Manual Part 2.

A3: Yes.
