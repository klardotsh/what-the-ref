# Q213: Regarding Team Prop patterns

Q: In Q192 and Q197, it was noted that patterns, logos, or images are prohibited as fidicuial markers under TE03.  We are wondering specifically if this will affect our team props depending on the interpretation of "pattern".

We want to ask if this ruling will apply to the circular indentations on our props, which are cubes that have indentations placed on each side to make them look like 6-sided dice (DICE is our team name).

A: The answers to Q192 and Q197 have been updated as follows:
Based on the feedback we have received from Teams and volunteers we are clarifying and relaxing the restrictions on the types of images that are allowed on the Team Prop. The intent of rule TE03b is:
1.	prevent the use of any object on the field that could confuse or distract other Robots.
2.	prevent the use of canned solutions to simplify the task of object identification.

Therefore, any image that resembles a QR code, AprilTag, or coded vision target is not allowed.  All other images such as team logos, sponsor logos, raised areas, cut outs, etc. are allowed, providing no other rule is violated. 

A Team Prop made as you described is legal providing all other rules are met.
