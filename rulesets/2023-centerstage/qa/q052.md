# Q052: Randomization Task Spike Mark Location Nomenclature

Q: Q1: For the autonomous randomization task, and placing the yellow pixel on the backdrop, what exactly is meant by “A yellow Pixel on the Backdrop in the location corresponding to the designated Spike Mark”? Is it that spike marks are inferred to be, facing the spike marks, left 1, top/middle 2, and right 3. Q2: Is it the same numbering for both red and blue alliance, in all positions?

A: A1: The answer that you seek is found by viewing illustrations E-3, E-4, and E-5 in Appendix E of Game Manual Part 2.

A2: Yes.
