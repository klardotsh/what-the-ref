# Q079: Solo cups as Team Prop

Q: Are Solo, or other disposable cups allowed to be used as team props this year. In Game Manual 1, Section 7.4. there is no mention of not using Solo or other cups. I recall last year they were not allowed due to many teams using them in Freight Frenzy. 
Additionally, <RM06> Current Season Game and Scoring Elements  does not disallow them either

A: Drinking cups in general are allowed providing they meet all the other Team Prop requirements, specifically size and uniform color.  Many cups have a solid exterior color but are white inside.  To be used in a Match, the cup would have to be oriented such that no white is visible, i.e. open side down. The cup would have to be inspected in the same orientation it will be used on the field.
