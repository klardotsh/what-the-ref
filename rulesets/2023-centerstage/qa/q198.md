# Q198: Double Sided Tape

Q: Can double-sided adhesive be used on our "pixel-picking up device" on our robot? We've designed a flat plate with double-sided crafting tape that is slightly sticky, leaves no residue and cannot actually reach the playing field. It can release pixels with a push rod system. More than happy to provide photos to help with description.

A: No, double-sided adhesive cannot be used on a "pixel-picking up" device. Any adhesive contact with a game element, scoring element, or field element is prohibited.
