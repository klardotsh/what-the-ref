# Q043: Drone in air when time is up

Q: A drone is launched during last couple seconds of the end game phase. Does the score count if the drone is launched right before the game finishes and lands after game time is up? We are talking about 2-3 seconds of margin where the drone might be launched and up in the air and time is up after the match.

A: Yes, the |Drone| is eligible to earn |Landing Zone| points per rule G20.b in Game Manual Part 2.
