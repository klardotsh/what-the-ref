# Q148: Container for driver control system

Q: Last year at the district championship, a referee warned our team that our driver control box limited the screen view for refereees.  We would appreciate a clarification on how much should be visible to the referee.  Our container is a “treasure box” which is part of our team’s pirate costume theme.  Currently, the treasure box surrounds the driver station on 4 sides plus the bottom, with walls extending to about midway up the REV driver station.

A: The driver control box as it is currently configured is not legal.  The current design blocks the view of the field and when opened has a possibility of extending into the field. The box can be made acceptable if the lid were removed completely rather than hinged.
