# Q120: Glitter PETG for team prop?

Q: The team prop can not be retroreflective. We 3D print a prop using PETG red transparent with glitter. It does not return a light beam back to it's source. Is this acceptable to use? The glitter in the filament is reflective but it is not retroreflective per the definition of "Retroreflection occurs when a surface returns a large portion of directed light beam back to its source. Retroreflective materials appear brightest to observers nearest the light source"

A: No, this is not a legal material. Red transparent PETG with metal flake does not satisfy rule TE02 for being a uniform color.
