# Q130: Motors moving during initialization

Q: RG02 mentions that servos can move during initialization to fit within the sizing limit. Q1: What about motors? If our robot is too large before initialization, can our initialization routine power motors to make the robot fit? Q2: If so, can the motors stay powered/stalling while the robot size is measured?

A: A1: Yes, provided that the motors do not stall and the same initialization process is used when setting up the |Robot| for a |Match|.

A2: No, stalling a DC motor for an extended period of time such as Pre-|Match| set up and inspection risks damaging the motor (most motors rely on spinning to ensure proper cooling) and consumes a significant amount stored energy from the |Robot's| main battery. More importantly, stalled motors can create smoke and noxious gases as well as generate extreme heat within the motor that can lead to fire (depending on the motor and materials surrounding the motor).
