# Q180: Is the drone part of the robot?

Q: For inspection purposes, is the drone considered part of the robot? Is it required to fit within the 18" sizing tool when preloaded? Or is the robot measured before the drone is preloaded? For example, the robot is 17.25" wide, but when the drone is preloaded and the robot is measured from the tip of the wing to the far side of the robot it is now 18.5" wide - is this legal and will it pass inspection?

A: For sizing purposes, the Drone is not considered part of the Robot.  Per Rule RG02a, "Preloaded game elements may extend outside the starting size constraint".
