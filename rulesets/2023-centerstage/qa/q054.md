# Q054: Pixel Possession in Autonomous

Q: A robot has a spinning intake that can extend ~3 feet in front of the robot, and in the process of intaking a stack in the autonomous period, the robot intakes 3 pixels. However, after the intake retracts, the 3rd pixel spits out of the robot. Would this be counted as a pixel control/possession limit violation?
