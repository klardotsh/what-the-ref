# Q012: Legal or illegal build kits.

Q: Can you inform me if Go bilda build kits have been deemed illegal?  There is no mention of them in the legal or illegal parts and I spent a lot of money upgrading this winter to try and compete.

A: Teams may acquire parts and materials from any readily available source, including GoBilda, providing they do not violate any robot build rules. Pay specific attention to Rules RM01 and RM02 when purchasing parts and kits.
