# Q008: Launching a Drone from Robot Suspended from Rigging

Q: Section 4.4.4.2 End Game states that launched drones must pass over the rigging and/or stage door to be considered for scoring, which seems reinforced by |GS11|e.  |GS11|d seems to consider drones launching from suspended robots separately.  Does a drone launched from a suspended robot need to pass over the rigging/stage door to score?

A: Yes.
