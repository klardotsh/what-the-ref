# Q025: Exceptions to rule RM02

Q: Good evening. Provided no other rules are violated, which of the following kits are legal COTS items under the <RM02> exception for COTS drive chassis? Assume that a "swerve module" is a collection of parts including a wheel and mechanisms to rotate the wheel in two axis. 1) A single "swerve module." 2) A bundle of 2 or more "swerve modules." 3) A complete "swerve" drivetrain, including 2 or more "swerve modules" and a frame, necessitating no additional parts to be assembled as a drive chassis.

A: Q1: A single swerve module kit does not meet the requirements in Rule RM02 and therefore is not legal. 

Q2: A bundle of swerve modules violates Rule RM02and is not legal.

Q3:  A complete drivetrain made up of illegal parts is not legal.
