# Q159: Question on Digital Break Beam Input Sensors

Q: Can you confirm that the following sensor would be legal.
https://www.adafruit.com/product/2168

Its an optical break beam sensor we would like to connect to a digital input on the control hub, can function on either 3.3V or 5V (We understand that for 5V you need Logic Level Converter)

A: In general, it is not possible for us to rule on the legality of all potential sensors.  When determining the legality of a particular sensor, apply the constraints imposed by RE11 as a guide to legality.

In this particular case, the "sensor" you are asking about is in two distinct parts; an IR LED emitter and a IR detector.

As long as the IR emitter is connected and powered in accordance with RE12 and the IR detector meets the constraints of RE11, the combination would be allowed
