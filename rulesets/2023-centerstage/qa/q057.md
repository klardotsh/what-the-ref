# Q057: Manipulation of pixels after being scored

Q: According to Game Manual 2, specifically <GS05>, it is stated that pixels scored on the backdrop are not subject to the control/possession limit. Does this imply that an alliance can freely manipulate any number of pixels on their backdrop even after they have been scored, as long as these pixels maintain contact with the backdrop?

A: Yes, provided that the |Robot| is not |In Tile| rows 1, 2, or 3 per rule |GS08|.d.
