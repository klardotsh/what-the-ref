# Q152: May a robot shoot pixels into the backdrop?

Q: May a robot use 2 spinning wheels to shoot pixels into the backdrop, while the robot is in the backstage area?

A: A |Robot| may use spinning wheels to eject |Pixels|, provided that the |Pixels| are not |Propelled| per rule GS10.

A |Robot's| |Pixel| manipulator that is adjacent to the |Backdrop| is allowed to eject |Pixels| with no more energy than needed to gently place |Pixel|s |On| the |Backdrop|. The expectation is that the ejected |Pixel| is in contact with the |Backdrop| and the wheels are simply used to release the |Pixel| from the |Robot|.

|Pixels| that are |Propel|led or ejected with excessive energy for |Scoring| violates rule GS10.
