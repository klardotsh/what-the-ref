# Q199: Is it legal to use an inline USB isolator to prevent ESD problems with the Logitech C270

Q: We continue to have control hub crashing issues due to ESD when the Logitech camera is plugged into any of the usb ports.  we've identified that it only crashes when the robot makes metal connection with the field elements, and only when the usb camera is connected.   
Is it legal to use an inline USB isolator such as an ADUM3160?

A: Yes. This is an example of the types of USB surge protectors allowed by RE14.a.
