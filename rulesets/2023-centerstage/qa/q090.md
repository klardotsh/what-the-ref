# Q090: What is the exact definition of "preloaded" pixels for autonomous?

Q: Can we place the purple pixel for randomization task on the field mat and push it to the spike mark, or the pixel has to be loaded onto the robot?

A: The answer that you seek is found by reading section 4.4.1 item 3.b and the definition of |Pre-Load| in section 4.3 of the Game Manual Part 2.

Yes, the |Drive Team| may set up their |Robot| on the |Playing Field| with their allowed |Pre-Load| purple |Pixel| on the |Playing Field Floor| provided that the |Pixel| is touching their |Robot|.
