# Q193: GoBilda Servo Voltage range acceptable for rule RE10?

Q: Our team is new and wanted to confirm whether this servo was acceptable for use.  RE10 states that servos that are compatible with the REV control hub are acceptable to use (three-wire servo connector, etc).  There's also a separate requirement for it to not exceed 6V.  The GoBilda servo 2000 Series Dual Servo Dual Mode (SKU: 2000-0025-0002) has a voltage range of 4.8V-7.4V (pulse amplitude of 3-5V).  Thank you.

A: We believe the wording of the existing servo rules may be a bit misleading in their intent with respect to operating voltages.

Servos that are compatible with a 5-6v range are allowed. The REV Expansion and Control Hubs produce 5v servo outputs. The REV Servo Power Module produces 6v.
