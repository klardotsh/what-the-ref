# Q181: Field wall keeping robot in starting configuration Rule <RG02>

Q: Can a robot with easily flexible parts (such as surgical tubing or a zip tie) start a match with these parts pressed up against the field wall in such a way that they would bend? If this is allowed, then during inspection could a team bend the parts in the same way which they will be bent on the field when a match starts in order to fit within the 18 inch sizing tool since that would be the configuration in which the robot would start the match.

A: No, the Robot must be within the 18" x 18" x 18" size without relying on any external forces from the sizing box or the wall.
