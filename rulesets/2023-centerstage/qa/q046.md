# Q046: Interaction with the Pixel and Props on the spike mark during autonomous

Q: During the autonomous period while traveling to our Alliance's Backstage, is there a penalty or de-scoring if our robot bumps: 
Q1: Our purple Pixel off the randomly selected Spike Mark.
Q2: Our prop off the randomly selected Spike Mark.
Q3: Our alliance partner's purple Pixel off the randomly selected Spike Mark.
Q4: Our alliance partner's prop off the randomly selected Spike Mark.

A: A |Robot| is allowed to descore a |Pixel| from its own |Alliance's Scoring Area|. The only consequence is the loss of |Score| value (points) for the descored |Pixel|.

A1: No |Penalty| and the |Purple Pixel| does not earn points for the |Spike Mark Randomization Task| if it is |Off| the designated (correct) |Spike Mark| at the end of the |Autonomous Period|.

A2: No |Penalty|.

A3: No |Penalty| and the |Purple Pixel| does not earn points for the |Spike Mark Randomization Task| if it is |Off| the designated (correct) |Spike Mark| at the end of the |Autonomous Period|.

A4: No |Penalty|.
