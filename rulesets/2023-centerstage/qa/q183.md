# Q183: <RE01> Allowable Power Switch Label

Q: Rule <RE01> specifies the requirements for the robot's main power switch label. Does the label shown in the rule have to be made from paper or can an appropriately sized and colored 3D printed replica of the label be used in place of the paper label? One example of a 3D printed power label can be found here https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3097705.

A: A multi-color plastic label is allowed if it is visually identical to the power button image shown in Game Manual Part 1 rule RE01.

The 3D printed power label referenced in the question is allowed because it is visually identical to the required label. The label has a white background, a red dashed line border, and the correct interior elements colored in black.
