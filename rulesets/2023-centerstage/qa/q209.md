# Q209: Venue floor for audience landing zone

Q: What is the intended floor for the Audience scoring zone for the drones? Some venues may have carpet and some are polished gym floors. I have seen some venues put foam tiles in the scoring zone. I have also been to gyms where they put tarps down for the robotics fields.  The implications to a teams end game score could be reliant on the friction of the scoring zone? Is there an ideal floor? Say for higher stakes meets, where teams can get eliminated? Like for state, regional or worlds?

A: The answer you seek is found in the definition of Landing Zone in Game Manual Part 2. Quoted here: 
>Recognize that |Landing Zone| surfaces and marking materials may vary from event to event. Potential surfaces include hardwood floors, carpeting, gym tarp, cement, tiles, mats, etc. Potential marking materials include tape, paint, etc. Teams should plan for these variances when competing at different events.

It is encouraged for Event Organizers to let teams know what the Landing Zone properties are.  We do not have any recommendation for what an ideal surface is.
