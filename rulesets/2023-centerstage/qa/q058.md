# Q058: Rule G05 clarification

Q: <G05> Robots or Scoring Elements that are eligible for two or more Scoring achievements earn points only for the highest value achievement. Q1: Is a Yellow Pixel placed On an Allianceâ€™s designated Backdrop location eligible for both the 20 point randomization task and the 5 point placement task? Q2: Will the Yellow Pixel then earn 3 points at the end of the Driver-Controlled Period? Q3: Are there other scenarios where rule G05 would apply (except Drones In multiple Landing Zones and Navigating)?

A: A1: The short answer is Yes. 

The yellow |Pixel| is in two |Scoring Areas|, |On| the |Backdrop| and |In| the |Backstage|. Applying rule G05, the |Pixel's| highest value achievement is for being |On| the |Backdrop|. During the |Autonomous Period|, all |Pixels| |On| the |Backdrop| earn five (5) points. The yellow |Pixel| has an additional |Randomization Task| scoring potential that is dependent upon its location |On| the |Backdrop| as described in section 4.4.2 item 2.b. The yellow |Pixel| may earn both the standard five (5) points for being |On| the |Backdrop| and the |Randomization Task| points for being in the location corresponding to the designated |Spike Mark|.

A2: Yes, if the yellow |Pixel| is |On| the |Backdrop| at the end of the |Match|.

A3: For the CENTERSTAGE game, rule G05 applies to: a) |Pixels| that are |On| the |Backdrop| and |In| the |Backstage|; b) |Robots| that are |Suspended| from the |Rigging| and are |Parked In| the |Backstage|; and c) |Drones In| two (2) |Landing Zones|.

Applying rule G05 to the |Navigation| scoring achievement during the |Autonomous Period| is not necessary because there is only one location based |Scoring Area| for the |Robot| during that |Match Period|.
