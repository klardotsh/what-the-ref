# Q111: Communication between Human Player and Drive Team

Q: My drive team is finding it near impossible to view the pixel(s) during intake from the wing (due to large opaque robot size). Is it legal for the human player to communicate with the drive team via: a) short verbal commands (forward, backward, intake, outtake, etc.), b) hand signs (raised finger(s), open palm, closed fist, etc.), c) small colored flags/paper tokens?

A: The |Human Player| actions described in a), b) and c) are all allowed provided that the |Human Player| does not:

1) Distract an opposing |Alliance Drive Team| per rule G16.c.

2) Reach |Into| the |Playing Field| per rule GS12.h.

3) Use electronics of any type per rule G11.

4) Dropping or placing signaling aids into the |Playing Field| are subject to rule G22.
