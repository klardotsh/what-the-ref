# Q169: Clarification of answer to Q141 - sharing of GND and 3.3v wires.

Q: Q141 says "No sharing of GND or 3.3v wiring." (full stop), which inspectors or officials could read more broadly than we think is intended. We seek to clarify Q141's answer. The analog/digital ports are designed to support two sensor inputs per physical port, e.g. using a REV-31-1386 sensor splitter cable. Q1: Can two or more sensors connected to a common digital/analog physical port share its GND/3.3v wires? Q2: Can multiple I2C devices sharing a common I2C port (bus) share its GND/3.3v wires?

A: !Q141 was meant to clarify that the power/ground bus used by sensors/pathways to provide signals should be scoped to the ports/connectors that provided it. For example, Digital Connector 0/1 on the Control Hub provides a power/ground plane intended to be used to power sensors/pathways to provide a signal for Digital Channel 0 and/or Digital Channel 1 - not for a device/pathway providing signal to Digital Channel 2 nor for Analog Channel 0, and certainly not for powering an I2C device chain.
