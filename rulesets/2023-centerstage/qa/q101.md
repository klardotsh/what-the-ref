# Q101: Clarification for Scoring on Backdrop

Q: According to S02, intentional robot extension outside the playing field perimeter is prohibited and will earn a yellow card if contact is made with any object. Wouldn't this mean robots are not intentionally allowed to extend above the upper half of the backdrop (which is located outside the field perimeter) even to score, and risk earning a yellow card? Given that propelling pixels is illegal (GS10), wouldn't that make scoring on the upper half of the backdrop essentially impossible?

A: Yes, |Robot| access to the entire |Backdrop| is necessary to fully play the game. When applying rule S02, the |Playing Field Perimeter| is extend outward to include the |Backdrop| boundary.
