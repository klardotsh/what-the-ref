# Q019: GoBilda Motor Legality

Q: Section <RE09> of Game Manual Part 1 does not list any type of GoBilda motor as an allowed motor. Seeing how GoBilda advertises their motors as FTC legal, they have been widely used in previous years, and that they are a selectable option in the robot configuration, are the 5203 Series GoBilda motors FTC legal?

A: goBILDA motor/gearbox combinations utilizing the Modern Robotics/MATRIX 12V DC Motors, along with their attached single degree-of-freedom gearboxes, are legal per rule RE10c. This currently includes motor/gearbox combinations in the goBILDA Yellow Jacket 5201, 5202, 5203, and 5204 series.
