# Q076: Points when splitting landing zone for Drone landing.

Q: When the Drone lands on a zone line between zones how are points counted? Say if the Drone lands on the zone line separating Zones 1 & 2 and 2 & 3.

A: The answer that you seek is found by reading rule G05 in Game Manual Part 2. Also, |Drone Landing Zone Scoring| example B1 in Appendix F, illustration F-5, shows how a |Drone Parked| in two |Landing Zones| is |Scored|.

Rule G05 states: "|Robots| or |Scoring Elements| that are eligible for two or more |Scoring| achievements earn points only for the highest value achievement. If the achievement values are equal, only one achievement counts as |Scored|."

Applying rule G05 to the two scenarios in the question:

A |Drone Parked| in both Landing Zones 1 & 2| earns 30 points for |Landing Zone 1|. 

A |Drone Parked| in both Landing Zones 2 & 3| earns 20 points for |Landing Zone 2|.
