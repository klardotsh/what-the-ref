# Q109: Pixel Stack Movement During Autonomous Period

Q: Q1: If a robot during the autonomous period rams the wall in a way that knocks over multiple pixel stacks (on both red and blue sides of the field). Would this be deemed a violation of GS03?

Q2: If a robot did this same action but only was able to knock over its own three stacks on its side of the field, would this be disallowed?

A: A1: For this |Autonomous Period| gameplay scenario, the consequences are dependent upon the location of the knocked over |Pixel Stack| as described below:

|Alliance’s| half of the |Playing Field|: There are no rule GS03 consequences. |Robots| are allowed to knock over |Pixel Stacks| on their |Alliance’s| side of the |Playing Field|, provided that all of the |Pixels| remain on the owning |Alliance’s| half of the |Playing Field|. |Pixels| relocated to the opposing |Alliance’s| half of the |Playing Field| are treated as described below if the |Pixels| impact an opposing |Alliance’s Robot|.

Opposing |Alliance’s| half of the |Playing Field|: Rule GS03.c is violated if knocking over or moving the |Pixels| impacts or impedes the opposing |Alliance’s| |Autonomous Period| |Scoring| actions. Per rule GS03.c, a |Major Penalty| will be applied for each impacted |Scoring| action by an opposing |Alliance Robot|. There are many possible opposing |Alliance Robot| |Scoring| actions that are protected by rule GS03.c. One example scenario is a |Major Penalty| is assessed for each cycle of an opposing |Alliance Robot|: a) driving up to a pre-set |Pixel Stack| location (i.e. on the white tape adjacent to the |Playing Field Wall|) to pick up a |Pixel|, and then b) moving away to continue playing the game. 

A2: See A1.

||Warning:|| The referee will likely have a conversation with the |Drive Team| about this gameplay scenario. |Robot| impact with the |Playing Field Wall| that knocks over a |Pixel Stack| is likely to be viewed as violating rule S01 for unsafe |Robot| operation.
