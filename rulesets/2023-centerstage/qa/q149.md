# Q149: is pneumatics allowed?

Q: One of my FTC student is interested in pursuing a pneumatics solution for the claw mechanism. I am trying to lean in and say YES to ideas right now and am exploring any legal or illegal game rules but don't see any related to pneumatics or dc motors with pump valve attachments?

A: No, Rule RG01 J expressly forbids the use of pneumatic devices.
