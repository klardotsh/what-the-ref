# Q017: FTC machine learning Tool chain: Start Training Model not getting enabled?

Q: I followed all process mentioned on FTC machine learning Tool chain manual (https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/ftc_ml/index.html ) to train and creating videos and Datasets with same Label but still "Start Training model" button is disable? Has anyone faced this problem?

A: Welcome to FIRST Tech Challenge! As a new (and even veteran!) team it can be difficult to know where to turn for help. Officially there are four places to get official information and help in FIRST Tech Challenge:

(1) Weekly [FIRST Tech Challenge Team Blasts](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/ftc/team-blast-archive) - Every week FIRST Tech Challenge provides the information teams crave! The archive gets updated periodically, but teams receive the emails each week with helpful Weekly Tech Tips (new!) and updates teams need to know.

(2) Periodically [FIRST Tech Challenge Blog](http://firsttechchallenge.blogspot.com/) and [FIRST Tech Challenge Social Media](https://www.facebook.com/FTCTeams/) - The Blog is FIRST Tech Challenge's place to talk more in-depth about topics of interest to FIRST Tech Challenge teams, and is updated periodically. Also the Social Media ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FTCTeams/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/first_official_/?hl=en), [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/FTCTeams), etc...) is a way to keep up with topics of interest.

(3) On-Demand [FTC-Community Forums](https://ftc-community.firstinspires.org/) - The FTC-Community forums are the official FIRST Tech Challenge forums for technical questions and help. This forum uses the same credentials that you use to access the FIRST Dashboard, and the forum is monitored by FIRST Tech Challenge Engineering Staff as well as the FIRST Tech Challenge Tech Team (as well as the Community!). If you've got a technical question, we technically have an answer! FTC-ML questions are absolutely welcome in the FTC-Community forums.

(4) On-Demand [FIRST Tech Challenge Question and Answer System](https://ftc-qa.firstinspires.org/) - That's this site you're using right now. This system is designed to help teams get clarification on game-specific questions. No other forum or system can give you official game-specific answers like this! This system also isn't designed for discussions like the FTC-Community forums are.

I hope this helps. Have a great season!
