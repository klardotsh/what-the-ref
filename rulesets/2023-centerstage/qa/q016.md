# Q016: Drone Launching

Q: How is "over" defined for the purpose of <4.4.4.2> "Launched Drones must pass over the Truss and/or Stage Door for each scoring attempt to earn points."

Specifically, does the drone need to be fully clear of touching its launching robot before the leading edge of the drone passes the plane over the Rigging or before the trailing edge leaves the plane above the Rigging?

A: A |Robot| must release  the |Drone| (i.e, no |Drone| contact with the |Robot|) before any part of the |Drone| passes over the |Rigging| or top pole of the |Stage Door|.

The following text demonstrates how to use the Game Manual to substantiate the answer.

The answer to the question is found by applying the game-specific definitions of "|Launch/Launching|" and "|Propel/Propelling|" found in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2 to rule GS11.e.

Rule GS11.e states that "for each scoring attempt (|Launch|, fly, land), a |Launched Drone| must pass over a |Rigging| or top pole of the |Stage Door| before it is eligible to |Score| points. The key point is that the |Drone| must be |Launched| before passing over the specified |Game Elements|. Next, we need to understand and apply the definition of "|Launch|."

"|Launch/Launching|" is defined as |Propelling Game Elements| through the air or water above the |Playing Field Floor|. Okay, now we need to review the definition of "|Propelling|."

"|Propel/Propelling|" is defined as giving |Game Elements| enough force such that they move independent of contact with the |Robot| or |Human Player|.

Therefore, a "|Launched|" |Drone| is no longer touching the |Robot|.
