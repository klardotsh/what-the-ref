# Q030: Drone trajectory height / distance

Q: Rule <RG07> Propelling Game Scoring Elements in GM1 states in part that scoring elements may only propel scoring elements with enough velocity to score and that Robots may not propel a scoring element in the air more than a 18 ft. (5.49 m) distance or more than 5 ft. (1.52 m) in elevation. Q1: Since the field + the scoring zone is 18' what is the penalty if the drone overshoots? Q2: How will the height be measured?

A: A1: The first instance of violating the |Drone| trajectory constraints during gameplay will not be penalized and the |Drone| is eligible to earn points for |Parking In| a |Landing Zone|. If a referee believes that the |Drone| exceeded the constraints described in rule RG07, the |Drone| must be reinspected before it can be used again in a |Match|.

A2: A typical |Drone| trajectory testing area will be an open space next to a wall. Tape on the floor and wall will mark the distance and height constraints. The |Robot| will be positioned so that the |Launched Drone's| trajectory is along/parallel to the wall. The inspector will observe the |Robot Launching| the |Drone| several times to determine compliance with rule RG07.
