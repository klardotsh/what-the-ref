# Q133: Outside home region league event rule

Q: May a team participate in another region's league events and their State Championship, if the home region has only the State Championship event? Understand that teams can only advance from their home region and can participate in one league tournament.

A: A team can participate in a League outside their region, provided that is the only League they participate in. A team may not advance from a League Tournament to a Regional Championship that is outside of their region unless the Program Delivery Partners in both regions have agreed to move a team to a new region for the entire season.
