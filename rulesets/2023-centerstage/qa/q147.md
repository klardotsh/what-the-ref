# Q147: Robots peeling tape off playing field tiles

Q: Some robots have been peeling tape off the field, such as those that include ramps to "scoop" pixels off the field. Q1: Would a team be penalized for peeling tape off the field, either partially or entirely? Q2: If yes, what is the penalty? Would it mean the part itself is illegal (violates <RG01>a), or the action of peeling the tape is illegal (violates <S01>)? Q3: For example, would a soft ramp that slides along the floor be legal, provided it never peels off tape or causes any other damage?

A: A1: Yes, rule S01 is violated if the damage is significant enough to require |Match| delaying repair.

A2: The consequences of violating rule S01 are described in section 4.5.1 of Game Manual Part 2: "If at any time the |Robot| operation is deemed unsafe or has damaged the |Playing Field| or another |Robot|, by the determination of the referees, the offending |Robot| may be |Disabled|, and the |Team| may be issued a |Yellow Card|. Re-inspection of the |Robot| is required before it may play another |Match|. Damage that requires significant repair and/or delays subsequent |Match| play is likely to escalate to a |Red Card|."

A3: Ramps are not inherently illegal |Robot| parts; how the ramp is used in gameplay determines its illegality unless the ramp is identified as having obviously unsafe characteristics during |Robot| inspection.
