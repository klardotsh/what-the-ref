# Q083: Will the OpenMV Cam RT1062 be allowed?

Q: We were wondering if the OpenMV Cam RT1062 qualifies as a Vision Sensor since you can upload your own code to it, but it doesn't stream images to the control hub if you use it with I2C, however, if you connect it with USB it can. (Section 7.2.1 Game Manual 1)

So is it allowed to be used?

A: No. This is a user programmable microcontroller board and as such falls into the category of "Additional Electronics disallowed by RE16.
