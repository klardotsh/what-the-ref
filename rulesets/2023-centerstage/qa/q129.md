# Q129: Is a drive team coach required for handling the driver station android device?

Q: My team doesn't have enough people able to attend the competitions to have the two people necessary to operate the robot, a coach, and a human player. Can we not have a coach and just have the gamepad operators also manage the driver station android device, or do we need to find another person?

A: Yes, the | Drive Team| is not required to have a |Coach|. The |Drivers| (i.e., gamepad operators) are allowed to hold the |Team's Driver Station| Android device and interact with it to select an Op Mode, view information displayed on the screen, and initialize, start, stop, and reset the |Robot| per rule G23.

||Note:|| Only one (1) |Human Player| represents an entire |Alliance| in a |Match| as stated in the definition of "|Drive Team|" in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2. The |Alliance| selects which |Team| supplies the |Human Player| for their |Match|. The |Human Player| that does not represent the |Alliance| during the |Match| is required to leave the |Competition Area| before the |Alliances| are directed by field personnel to approach the |Playing Field| to set up their |Robots|.
