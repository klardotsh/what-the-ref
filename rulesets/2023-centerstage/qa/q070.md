# Q070: Drone Curved Glide Path

Q: Q1: The answer to Q30 may imply that only straight drone flights are permitted, what if a drone is meant to follow a curved glide path?

Q2: Is it right to assume that the drone cannot exceed a 12' wide x 18' long x 5' high space flight space?

Q3: If following a curved trajectory, may a drone leave the field space before returning to the Landing Zone?

A: A1: In general, a curved glide path is allowed.

A2: The Game Manual does not specify a lateral (wide) trajectory constraint. The geometry of the gameplay area is the practical limitation for the |Drone| trajectory. The eighteen (18) ft. long and five (5) ft. high |Drone| trajectory limits described in rule RG07 will be enforced.

A3: A |Drone| is allowed to exit the |Playing Field| in any direction. There are consequences if the |Drone| impacts something |Outside| the |Playing Field Wall| as described in rules GS11.g.iii, GS11.g.iv, GS11.g.v., and S1 if there is a safety hazard.

||Note 1:|| |Drone| trajectory strategies that exit the |Playing Field Perimeter| other than through the audience edge of the |Playing Field Wall| do so at their own risk. 

||Note 2:|| A |Drone| impacting a |Drive Team| member of either |Alliance| in a manner that is not interference (i.e., the |Drive Team| member was not able to avoid being hit) should be treated as a |Scoring Element| out of bounds and returned to the owning |Alliance's Pixel Storage| at the earliest, safe opportunity.
