# Q073: RM06 and the Prop

Q: Is it correct to conclude that RM06 does not constrain (the design or construction of) the prop?

A: Yes, Rule RM06 applies to the |Team Prop|.  Note that RM06 should be interpreted as pertaining only to the previous season's game elements (Power Play), not every game element from every FTC game.
