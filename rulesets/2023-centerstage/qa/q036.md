# Q036: T265 camera legal this year?

Q: Will the Intel T265 Tracking Camera be legal this season 2023-2024? This camera model was legal in the past. A lot of teams purchased and spent a lot of time on them already.

A: No, the Intel T265 is not legal for use. The Intel T265 is a stereoscopic (having more than one image sensor) camera which would violate rule RE13.b.iii in Game Manual 1.
