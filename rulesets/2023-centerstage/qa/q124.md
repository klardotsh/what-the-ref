# Q124: Possession of pixels on backdrop clarification.

Q: Q57 makes it clear that pixels on the backdrop do not count toward the possession limit. If a robot is holding two pixels, will it incur possession penalties by removing a pixel from the backdrop (therefore no longer being supported by the backdrop) and placing it back on the backdrop?

A: The answer that you seek is found by reviewing the |Robot Control/Possession| limits for |Scoring Elements| rule (GS05). 

After removing the |Pixel| from the |Backdrop|, the |Robot| in this scenario is no longer protected by rule GS05.c.v and is therefore |Possessing| three (3) |Pixels|, one (1) more than the maximum allowed number of |Pixels| per rule GS05.a. The |Robot/Alliance| should receive an immediate |Minor Penalty| for |Possessing| one  |Pixel| over the allowed limit of two (2) |Pixels|. An additional |Minor Penalty| for the excess |Possessed Pixel| should be assessed for each 5-second interval that the |Robot| continues to |Possesses| three (3) |Pixels|.

If the |Robot| |Scores| a |Pixel| on the |Backdrop| or in the |Backstage| while |Possessing| three (3) |Pixels|, the |Robot/Alliance| will receive an additional |Minor Penalty| per rule GS05.b.
