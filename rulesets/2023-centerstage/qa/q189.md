# Q189: Penalty for Robot Outside Vertical Plane

Q: If a robot extends beyond the vertical plane of the field is there a penalty incurred? It is only for a moment as it drops a pixel, spins around, and begins cycling again. This happened in autonomous for us, but it could be during driver-controlled as the team controls the bot.

A: |Robots| that extend |Outside| the |Playing Field Perimeter| are potentially unsafe. Per rule S02, |Robot| contact with anything |Outside| the |Playing Field Perimeter| should result in a |Yellow Card| and if there is danger in allowing the |Robot| to continue operation, it should be |Disabled|.

Rarely occurring, |Inadvertent|, safe extension |Outside| the |Playing Field Perimeter| should not be |Penalized|. Repeated |Robot| extensions |Outside| the |Playing Field Perimeter| is no longer considered to be |Inadvertent| and is therefore not allowed.
