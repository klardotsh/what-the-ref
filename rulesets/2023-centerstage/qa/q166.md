# Q166: Clarification on Q155 for robot that begins climb after timer hits 0:00

Q: The answers to Q18 and Q78 make sense to me, but Q155 seems confusing related to a match I saw on webcast. A robot was still touching the ground at 0:00 when the buzzer started and the robot only left the floor while the buzzer was sounding. The definition of "Scored at the End of the Period" makes me think this would not count as a suspended robot, but Q155 makes me think it might.

A: Thank you for identifying the inconsistency between the answers to !Q18 and !Q155. !Q18 was updated on November 6, 2023 to include 
the end of |Match| scoring system buzzer length is a "grace period" for completing the |End Game Suspension| task.
