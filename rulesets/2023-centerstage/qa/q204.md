# Q204: Team Prop Design

Q: As an extension to some Team Prop Questions.

Q1:If a 3d printed team prop is designed to look like a cute cartoon robot, may it have eyes engraved/extruded in it since Q176 allows for holes in team props, or would those be considered fiduciary markers as per Q197?

Q2:Are decorative designs engraved/extruded into a prop allowed if not used for vision control?

A: The answers to Q192 and 197 have been updated as follows.

Based on the feedback we have received from Teams and volunteers we are clarifying and relaxing the restrictions on the types of images that are allowed on the Team Prop. The intent of rule TE03b is:
1.	prevent the use of any object on the field that could confuse or distract other Robots.
2.	prevent the use of canned solutions to simplify the task of object identification.

Therefore, any image that resembles a QR code, AprilTag, or coded vision target is not allowed.  All other images such as team logos, sponsor logos, raised areas, cut outs, etc. are allowed, providing no other rule is violated. 

A1: Yes this would be legal.

A2: Yes, engraved/extruded designs are allowed provided they do not violate the requirements outlined above.
