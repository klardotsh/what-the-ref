# Q049: Moving pixels from spike marks

Q: Q1: If the purple pixel is placed on the spike mark in the scoring position, but due to movement of robots doing other tasks, if it moves the pixel from the spike mark (alliance robot or opponent robot), how does the scoring work?

Q2: If the achievement score is determined right after autonomous, in the driver-controlled period, can we use that spike mark pixel for badkrop/backstage scoring purpose?
