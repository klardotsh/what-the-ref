# Q131: Yellow pixel straddling backdrop position corresponding to two spike marks

Q: Improbable as It may seem, this has now happened 2-5% of runs, wherein the yellow pixel delivered by the robot in autonomous period jumps around to settle over a position corresponding to two spike marks! The pixel's edge rests over the crest of the backdrop slots. See https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gIEEtlAQ1KHr4CF19mJkUWxGK5fp-6xP&usp=drive_fs where BLUE robot delivered yellow pixel, for RIGHT team prop location, over a crest.
Q: Does the team earn yellow pixel placement bonus points?

A: A: The |Pixel| shown in the image does not satisfy the |Scoring| requirements for the |Autonomous Period| |Backdrop| |Randomization Task|. The |Pixel| is not touching a valid |AprilTag| |Scoring| surface; it is balanced on the crest. The |Pixel| does earn five (5) points for being |On| the recessed |Scoring| area of their |Alliance Backdrop|.

See illustrations E-3, E-4, E-5, and E-6 in Game Manual Part 2 for examples of legally |Score|d |Pixels| for the |Autonomous Period| |Backdrop| |Randomization Task|.
