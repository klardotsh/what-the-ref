# Q177: We made a very small drone

Q: Our team has found and optimal drone design for our launch system, but its design is strange and we would like to confirm that It is allowed. It has a clearly defined wings and fuselage, and is 1.5 inches long 2 inches wide (Including wingspan) and 1 1/4 inches tall. Is this and acceptable drone design?

A: We believe !Q178 answers your question about size. If it does not, please rephrase your question and resubmit. As for the shape, please refer to the document "Is your Drone Legal" located at https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/is-your-drone-legal.pdf
