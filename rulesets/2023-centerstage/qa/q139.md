# Q139: Purple Pixel scoring exactly on Spike Mark

Q: 4.2.2 #3a, 4.4.2 #2a and forum answers indicate that the purple pixel must be placed On the randomly selected Spike Mark to score.
Appendix E â€“ Randomization E-1 through E-5 show the white pixel on the spike mark Scoring examples E-7, E-8, and E-9 show bonus scored when a purple pixel was on the taped line or on the white pixel; purple pixel was not exactly on the spike mark center line to score bonus. Question: Does the purple pixel score bonus if purple pixel is anywhere On the correct tape?

A: The answer that you seek is found by reading the definition of |Spike Mark| in section 4.3 and the |Scoring| requirement stated in section 4.4.2 #2.a in Game Manual Part 2.

From section 4.3, the |Spike Mark| is the entire one (1) inch wide by twelve (12) inch long piece of tape. 

The |Randomization Task Scoring| task requirement from section 4.4.2 #2.a is that the purple |Pixel| must be placed |On| the designated |Spike Mark|.

Combining the definition of |Spike Mark| with the |Randomization Task Scoring| task requirement, the purple |Pixel| can be anywhere |On| the correct tape line to be eligible to earn the |Spike Mark Randomization Task| points.
