# Q186: Drone flight path height

Q: Rule RG07 states the robot must not propel the drone with enough velocity to exceed 5' in height. If a robot is designed and inspected to follow this rule, but during gameplay the drone exceeds 5' in height, is this a penalty? Is the drone still scored?

A: We believe !Q30 answers your question. If it does not, please rephrase your question and resubmit.

The first instance of violating the Drone trajectory constraints during gameplay will not be penalized and the Drone is eligible to earn points for Parking In a Landing Zone. If a referee believes that the Drone exceeded the constraints described in rule RG07, the Drone must be reinspected before it can be used again in a Match.
