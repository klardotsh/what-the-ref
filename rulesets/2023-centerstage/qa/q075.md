# Q075: Servo legality

Q: Is this servo legal, https://a.co/d/cFk2HOy?  If not, are there any legal servos that have 50-70 kg per centimeter with 270 degree rotation?

A: In general, it is not possible for us to rule on the legality of every possible servo.
As long as the servo meets the criteria in RE10 it is legal.

We thought it important to add a few cautions for teams exploring large servos:
- watch your total power budget. the main robot battery is fused at 20A
- the servo power module is over-current limited at 15A
- pay attention to the stall current.  the above servo has a 8.5A stall current - a significant percentage of total robot power and of servo power module capacity
- plan for variances in the stated stall currents for servos - a plus/minus 10% variance is likely 
- sustained high-current draw can cause the battery to "brown out", with the voltage dropping. large drops can cause loss of connectivity and reboots of control/expansion hubs
