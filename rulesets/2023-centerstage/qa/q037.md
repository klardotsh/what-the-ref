# Q037: Will TGE (Team Prop) orientation be maintained during randomization?

Q: GM2 section 4.4.1(4)(c) says that field personnel will move the Randomization Object to the chosen Spike Mark.  For teams using TGE (Team Props), will the field personnel attempt to maintain the orientation of the TGE as placed on the field by the Drive Team, or should teams anticipate that the TGE orientation will change as a result of randomization?

A: Yes, field personnel will strive to maintain the |Team Prop's| orientation when it is repositioned to a different |Spike Mark|. 

Randomization relocation is not a precision activity, |Teams| should design their |Team Prop| detection system to tolerate some change in orientation when it is relocated. The |Drive Team| should immediately alert field personnel if there is a significant change in the |Team Prop's| orientation. Using the referee question box after the |Match| ends to alert the Head Referee about a change in |Team Prop| orientation during randomization is too late to affect any |Match| outcome and it is not a justification to replay a |Match|.
