# Q211: Pixel in both backstages at once

Q: Q1: Our question is about a |pixel| that is in both the |backstages| at ones does this mean it is scored for both |alliances|? Q2: And if so is it a penalty for moving that |pixel| to only your |backstage| (officially descoring it for the opposing alliance)

A: A1: No, a |Pixel| straddling the small nexus of the two |Backstage| |Areas| does not count as |Scored| for either |Alliance|.

A2: The question is not applicable since the |Pixel| is not in a |Scored| state while it is in both |Alliances'| |Backstage| |Areas|.
