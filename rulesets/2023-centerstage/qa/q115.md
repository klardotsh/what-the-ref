# Q115: Can the Drone have print on it?

Q: Are you able to have printing on the drone?

If it is unseen?

A: Yes, printing is allowed provided rule DR05 b is satisfied, no other rules are violated and the printing is not offensive. Note that the rules for the Team Scoring Element (Drone) are different than the rules for the Team Game Element (Team Prop). The Drone only needs to be predominantly red or blue and may have images, symbols, lettering, on it. The reason for the rule requiring predominantly red or blue is so that Field Personnel can easily determine which alliance earns points.
