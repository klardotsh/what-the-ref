# Q179: COTS Scissor Lift

Q: Are scissor lifts legal (specifically with regard to RM02)? The scissor lift will move up and down. It will be turned by a handle that rotates. This is the only axis of rotation we can identify. Do the lifts contain more than one axis of rotation or not?

A: Update 11/16/223
Yes, this is a legal COTS mechanism. It meets the singe degree of freedom rule. One input (rotation of the leadscrew) for one output (vertical lift of the stage).
