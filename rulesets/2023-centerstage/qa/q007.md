# Q007: Pixel stack orientation on location line

Q: Will the pixels be placed on the pixel locations stripes in a known orientation such as flat against the wall or is the orientation random?

A: Based on the Field Reset guide located in the Game and Season Information page (https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/ftc/game-and-season-info), "Each stack of 5 |Pixels| is centered from side to side on each of the white tape lines on the audience side of the field. The |Pixels| should be touching the field perimeter wall".  There is no specification of orientation both collectively and individually in each stack. In other words, |Pixels| can be in any setup as long as they are each touching the field perimeter wall.  Teams should design their intake mechanisms accordingly.
