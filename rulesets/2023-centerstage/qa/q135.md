# Q135: Legal or not drone not answered yet

Q: I have submitted the pdf file for a design through the special link to upload file, no answer yet, or I am not looking at the right place?  Q117, Q127

A: The review process is now operational.  Please remember that all submissions must be of a final, match ready Drone.  That means the color must be correct, it must have a Team Number,  be made from the allowed materials, and be the correct size and shape.  A Drone violating any of the DR rules will be deemed illegal.
