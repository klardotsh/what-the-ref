# Q155: Clarification on Q78 robot suspension only during buzzer sound

Q: In GM Part 2: 4.4.4 - 1. Robot Location â€“ There are two mutually exclusive location-based Scoring opportunities, <if> Robot Location is Scored at End of the Period
Q1: Is it accurate to say that as long as the robot is obviously suspended at some point during the end of match buzzer it should be scored as a suspend? Q2: Or must the robot have begun its suspension by the 2:00 mark which is defined as end of period?

A: A1: Yes, provided that the |Robot| does not start |Suspending| before the |End Game Period| begins.

A2: A |Robot| is not required to be |Suspended| before the 2:00 minute time mark.
