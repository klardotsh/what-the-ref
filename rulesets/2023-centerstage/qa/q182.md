# Q182: Can team props be different based on the alliance colors?

Q: Our team wants to use a different team prop based on whether we are on the red or blue alliance for each match. Assuming the team props meet all of the other requirements and both are inspected, is it legal to use two different shaped team props based on the alliance color?

A: There is no rule requiring that the red and blue Team Props be the same design. All Team Props must pass Inspection prior to use in a match.
