# Q165: Autonomous Initialization Routine gamepad control

Q: During pre-match robot setup, is it legal to include code to enable gamepad functionality during the autonomous initialization routine?  For example, is it allowed to have the gamepad buttons control a servo to open and close a gripper to preload pixels before the referee signals that pre-match set up is complete.

A: Yes, provided that the operation is performed safely and does not delay the start of a |Match| (G13.e).
