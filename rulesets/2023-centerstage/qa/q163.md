# Q163: Robot signaling to Human Player

Q: Ref. <G11>, Q125, & Q111, Drive Team communication to Robot, for signaling to the Human Player. <G11> permits use of the Driver Station for “operating the robot”. Is it still legal, if its purpose is to signal the Human Player?  e.g.:  A Driver Station command causes a Robot-mounted servo to raise a colored semaphore flag, or illuminate an indicator light on the Robot. The Human Player sees this signal, and selects a colored pixel to place in the wing, based on the color of the flag, or light.

A: The action described is legal, provided that the signaling device does not distract or interfere with an opposing |Alliance Drive Team| per rules RE12.b, and G16.c.
