# Q022: Drone construction by cutting up paper sheet into smaller parts.

Q: Rule <DR05> Construction Material Constraints: states - "... The Drone must be made of a single, continuous sheet of paper no larger than a single sheet of 8 Â½ x 11 or A4 size uncoated printer paper. ..."


Q1: Can the paper size be smaller than the standard  Letter/A4 size paper?
Q2: Can the paper be cut up to make individual drone parts that are later attached together? Team members thought of an origami airplane that requires multiple separate parts that need to be joined together.

A: Q1: Yes, a Drone may be made from a single sheet of paper smaller than a standard letter/A4 sheet.
Q2: No, multiple pieces of paper, even if in aggregate they are less than a standard letter/A4 sheet, are not allowed.
