# Q214: Autonomous Setup

Q: As long as it doesn't delay the game, can the drive team use one of the pre-loaded pixels to space the robot off the tile teeth, then place it in the robot before initialization?

A: No, per Rule ||G15||, you may not use a |Pixel| to align the |Robot|. |Pixels| are not a legal component of the |Robot|.
