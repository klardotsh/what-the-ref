# Q014: Launching Pixels

Q: Launching is defined as "Propelling Game Elements through the air or water above the Playing Field Floor." 

Q1: Are Pixels considered launched if they stay in contact with the floor? 

Q2: In other words, can be slid along the floor and not be considered Launched and if so, are there any constraints in how far they can go?

A: An understanding of the game-specific defined terms "|Propel/Propelling|", "|Launch/Launching|", and "|Slide/Sliding|" found in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2 is necessary to fully understand Q1, Q2, and their answers. Please take a moment to review these definitions before proceeding. 

The "bonus information" following answers A1 and A2 addresses a related gameplay scenario that complements Q1 and Q2.

A1: No, a |Pixel| that is "in contact with the floor" does not satisfy the definition of "|Launched|" in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2.

A2: A |Pixel| "slid along the floor" does not satisfy the definition of "|Launched|" because the |Pixel| remains in contact with the "Playing Field Floor".

||Bonus Information:|| Rule GS10 states that |Pixels| may not be |Propelled|. Each violation of this rule results in a |Minor Penalty|. To understand how to apply rule |GS10| to |Pixels| that are |Slid| by a |Robot|, we need to review the definitions of "|Sliding|" and "|Propelling|".

"|Sliding|" is defined as |Propelling Game Elements| along the |Playing Field Floor|. 

"|Propelling|" is giving |Game Elements| enough force such that they move independent of contact with the |Robot| or |Human Player|. |Launching|, |Rolling|, and |Sliding| are forms of |Propelling|. 

Since "|Sliding|" is a form of "|Propelling|", a |Robot| causing a |Pixel| to |Slide| violates rule |GS10|.
