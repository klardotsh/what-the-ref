# Q103: Can a robot go to other side of the truss in autonomous?

Q: I don't know if we heard this improperly, but at a Kickoff event, we heard that robots cannot travel to the other side of the trusses during autonomous. Is this true?

A: |Robots| are allowed to travel through the |Truss| and/or |Stage Door| during the |Autonomous| and |Driver Controlled Periods|.
