# Q001: Drones and backdrop

Q: When having a discussion of the rules about the backdrop and drones. Several students questioned what would happen if a drone went back and hit the backdrop and knocked down pixels of the opposite alliance. Would there be a penalty for the drone hitting the backdrop.

A: The |Pixel| descoring rule, |GS04|, applies to this gameplay scenario. A |Minor Penalty| will be assessed for each |Pixel| descored from the opposing |Alliance's Backdrop|.
