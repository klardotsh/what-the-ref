# Q136: Voltage Sensor

Q: Are digital voltmeters allowed? (This is the one we have been using: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086RHJ95R/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1).

A: The referenced voltage sensor is not allowed because it is not powered by a REV Expansion Hub or REV Control Hub via analog, digital, encoder, or I2C ports as required by rule RE05.c in Game Manual Part 2.
