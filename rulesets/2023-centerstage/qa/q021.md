# Q021: Drone Trajectory

Q: The rule <DR02> states â€“ "... the aerodynamic surfaces cause the Drones to follow a non-ballistic trajectory while flying."
There is a non-zero chance that, unintentionally, the drone ends up flying with a near ballistic trajectory. 
Q: Does the team incur a penalty if this happens?

A: If the |Drone| has passed inspection and it remains in a legal configuration (rule GS11.f) throughout the |Match|, a gameplay penalty is not assessed if it flies with a "near ballistic trajectory."

A referee may require the |Drone| to be reinspected before it is used in a subsequent |Match| if there is concern that it violates a construction rule.
