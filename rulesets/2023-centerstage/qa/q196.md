# Q196: Clarification on Wound Springs and Degrees of Freedom

Q: Regarding RM02

Would a sub assembly that contains a wound spring but produces a linear motion be allowed (as a single DOF)?  Specific examples being a tape measure and a retractable badge holder.  In both cases the body internally contains an inaccessible rotary mechanism, but what extends from the body (metal tape and string respectively) is linear.  Would the gimbled fitting on the end of the badge holder be disallowed as an added DOF?  If so, could we modify the badge holder to remove?

A: Tape measures and similar devices, like a badge holder, are allowed. There is no need to take off the gimbaled fitting on the badge holder.
