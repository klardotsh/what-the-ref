# Q116: Parking in the backstage at the end of autonomous

Q: At the end of the autonomous period, the robot can earn 5 points for being parked in the appropriate backstage area. How much of the robot must be within the taped area to earn the bonus points?

A: The answer that you seek is found by reading the the definition of "|In|" found in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2.

The definition of "|In|" in section 4.3 is:  "An object that has crossed into the upwards vertical extension (i.e., at a right angle to the |Playing Field Floor|) of a defined |Area’s| boundary is |Inside| the |Area|. An object that is entirely within the upwards vertical extension of a defined |Area’s| boundary is |Completely Inside| the |Area|. The boundary element (tape, wall, markings, etc.) is part of the |Area| for the purposes of determining |Inside| and |Outside|, unless otherwise specified."

The |Autonomous| |Navigation| task requirements are satisfied if the |Robot| is |Parked| (i.e., motionless) and any portion of the |Robot| has crossed into the upwards vertical extension (i.e., at a right angle to the |Playing Field Floor|) of the |Backstage| taped boundary.

||Pro Tip:|| The scoring referee has a short period of time between the end of the |Autonomous Period| and the start of the |Driver-Controlled Period| to record all of the |Autonomous Period| |Scoring| tasks. |Teams| can help the scoring referee accurately record an |Alliance's| scoring tasks by designing their |Autonomous| software so that their |Robot| is unambiguously |In| the |Backstage| at the end of the period.
