# Q089: Grappling Hook

Q: Does the interpretation of <RG06> include grappling hooks? In other words if a hook mechanism is attached to the Rigging, then released form the robot so that it is only held by aircraft cable and then that cable is winched back in order to lift the robot, is this allowed?

A: A mechanism that operates as described is legal. Note that launching the hook is not legal.
