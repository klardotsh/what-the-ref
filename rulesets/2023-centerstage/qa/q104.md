# Q104: Wing penalty during autonomous period

Q: GS09 gives major (plus minor) penalties for robots moving in the opposing alliance Wing. However, the wing has no function until driver controlled period and it is in the interference-free half of the field.  The robot in the starting location near the wing has very limited spaces to maneuver during autonomous. Should penalties be given for this during autonomous when there is no negative impact to the opposing team (assuming out by end of period)?

A: Rule GS09 applies to all periods of gameplay. However, a limited, brief, and |Inconsequential| entry into the opposing |Allianceâ€™s Wing| during the |Autonomous Period| is likely to be excused by the referee per rule G10.
