# Q064: GS12 - Human player inadvertently and temporarily straying into wing/field

Q: Scenario: There is no robot in the wing. During the gameplay, the human player inadvertently leans her head over the vertical plane of the field perimeter, into the wing/field area, perhaps to enjoy the gameplay. Q1: Does the team incur an immediate penalty in this scenario? Q2: Human player realizes her action and backs her head out of the wing/field within X seconds. Does the team still incur a penalty in this scenario? Q3: If the answer to Q2 is no, what is the value of X?

A: A1: The |Human Player| should receive a |Warning| the first time they extend into the |Playing Field Perimeter| without demonstrating a clear intent to place a |Scoring Element| into the |Wing|. Subsequent extensions into the |Playing Field Perimeter| without the intent of placing |Scoring Elements| into the |Wing| should receive a |Minor Penalty| for each occurrence per rule |GS12|.

A2: Same answer as A1.

A3: Not applicable.
