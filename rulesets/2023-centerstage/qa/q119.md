# Q119: Definition of COTS Battery

Q: Per RE12 F.ii, it states that an external COTS USB battery pack is allowed to power LEDs on the robot. What is considered an external COTS battery pack? What are the limitations on said battery packs? Additionally, are converters designed to pull 12V from the battery pack such as https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NRM6X2Y allowed? It would be connected to this adapter to allow use with the REV Blinkin https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHNNWJMD.

A: The COTS USB battery pack mentioned in RE12.f.ii is a simple USB charging battery intended to allow mobile recharging of USB powered devices (phones, tablets, etc). There are many [examples](https://www.anker.com/products/a1287) available from many sources.

Thank you for asking about Battery Pack limitations. COTS USB Battery Packs are limited to a capacity of 27,000mAh or less. This is also the standard [TSA limit](https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/packsafe/lithium-batteries) for taking Lithium-containing COTS USB Battery Packs (with 3.7V cells) onto aircraft in the USA.

COTS USB Battery Packs that adhere to the USB-PD or USB-QC specification may be used to provide a 12V source as described. Please ensure that the COTS USB External Battery is in no way connected to the robot's power system.

When using COTS USB External Battery Packs for legal LED and related uses, please observe a heightened level of vigilence in their safe use. The [Robot Controller Power Distribution page](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/control_hard_compon/rc_components/power_distr/power-distr.html) on ftc-docs has been updated with proper guidance for [using COTS USB External Battery Packs](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/control_hard_compon/rc_components/power_distr/power-distr.html#cots-usb-battery-pack). Please review this information prior to using any COTS USB External Batteries.
