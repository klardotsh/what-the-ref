# Q184: Is modifying the case of a webcam legal?

Q: Is modifying the housing of the vision sensor circuit/PCB legal? To be clear, we are not modifying the circuit, only the case of the webcam. The 3D printed housing wouldn’t affect the safety. <RE15> says “Approved electrical and electronic devices may be modified to make them more usable; they may not be modified internally or in any way that affects their safety.” The modification would comply with <RE13 B> and <RE11>. Documentation of the modification could be presented at inspection.

A: Modifications to the housing of a vision sensor are acceptable as long as the modifications don't obscure the identification of the vision sensor for robot inspectors
