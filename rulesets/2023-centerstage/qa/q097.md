# Q097: Drone launch before end game

Q: If for some reason our drone was launched accidentally before the end game starts, do we get a penalty?

A: There is no |Penalty| for |Launching| a |Drone| before the start of the |End Game|. The |Drone| is not eligible to earn |Landing Zone| points per section 4.4.4 in Game Manual Part 2 because it was |Launched| before the start of the |End Game|. 

If the |Drone| is accessible |Inside| the |Playing Field Boundary|, the |Robot| may try another |Drone Scoring| attempt per rule GS11.e.
