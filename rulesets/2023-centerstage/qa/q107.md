# Q107: Pixel stack stabilization

Q: The answer to Q20 notes it is legal to intake pixels (from a stack) while the robot is touching other pixels on a stack, provided the robot does not already control any other pixels. We seek clarification that bracing the pixel stack against say the field wall, while extracting a pixel from that stack, does not constitute herding (and thus control), since the manual defines as pushing one/more scoring elements to a desired...direction.

A: We believe !Q24 answers your question. If it does not, please rephrase your question and resubmit.

Bracing the |Pixel Stack| against the |Playing Field Wall|, while extracting a |Pixel| from that stack, does not constitute |Control| of the |Pixel Stack|.
