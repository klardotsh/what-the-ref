# Q154: Can the team numbers be on a moving part or the robot?

Q: The most visible part of our robot where we could install the team numbers is on our arm. Would we be allowed to install the team number onto the arm even though it moves? Another point of concern is that at some points in the game the team number might be upside down.

A: Yes, placing numbers on a moving part of the Robot is allowed providing the numbers are always clearly visible through the range of motion of the mechanism.  A Team Number that is temporarily upside down is acceptable.
