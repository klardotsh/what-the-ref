# Q141: [GND, 3.3V] Buses

Q: The [GND, 3.3V] pins on the REV Hubs appear to be on the same internal [GND, 3.3V] buses.  Is it permissible to connect the [GND, 3.3V] pins to external [GND, 3.3V] buses?  External Bus could be two wires of appropriate guage on a slip ring or coiled wire.  We feel this would simplify wiring for many applications.

A: No sharing of GND or 3.3v wiring. For two predominant reasons;
- keep the inspection process simple and easy to understand
- not all 3.3v ports are internally connected to the same protections circuit.
