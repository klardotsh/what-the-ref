# Q185: How long does the drive team have to start their autonomous op mode?

Q: If we communicate with our alliance and find out that our autonomous modes would collide with each other, would we be able to wait to activate our autonomous until their robot has safely passed the point of collision? Another way of saying it is, how long do we have to start our autonomous after the autonomous period has started?

A: The answer that you seek is found by reading section 4.4.2 and rule G19 in Game Manual Part 2.

No, delaying the start of the |Autonomous| Op Mode is illegal human operation of the |Robot| during the |Autonomous| gameplay period. The |Autonomous| Op Mode must start immediately following the "3-2-1 Go" |Match| start countdown.
