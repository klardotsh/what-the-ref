# Q191: Roughtop tread used in something other than drivetrain

Q: <RG01> a. says "The following types of...parts are not allowed: Those used in a Robot drive system that could potentially damage the Playing Field and/or Scoring
Elements such as high traction wheels and high grip tread." The legal/illegal parts document seems to flat-out ban the HiGrip Wheel and Rough top Tread. If those parts were used in a way that were unlikely to damage anything (say high grip tread as flappy intake), would they be allowed?

A: High grip tread may not be used in any device that contacts the tile floor due to potential damage to the soft rubber tile. However, the tread may be used elsewhere on the Robot, provided that it does not damage Game Elements
