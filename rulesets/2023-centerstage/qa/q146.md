# Q146: REV Blinkin firmware update and/or customization

Q: REV has instructions for updating the firmware in the Blinkin LED Driver, including how to modify the firmware to create custom light patterns.   https://github.com/REVrobotics/Blinkin-Firmware
Q1: Could custom firmware following the "Creating a custom function" instructions solely for producing custom light patterns to indicate the color of pixels held in the robot be legal? 
Q2: If no, would it still be legal to follow REV's instructions to update the OEM firmware without modification?

A: The answer to both questions is no.

Updating the REV Blinkin firmware in the described manner would violate RE15 - for allowed modifications as well as RE16 as the system would now effectively be equivalent to a generic programmable device (i.e. arduino, raspberry pi, etc.)
