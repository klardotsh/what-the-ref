# Q172: Clarification on powering USB hub for Control Hub (RE13/RE14)

Q: RE13.b.ii specifies that Vision Cameras can connect to REV Control Hub (Robot Controller) using a "powered USB hub", but doesn't mention allowed power sources for the USB hub. RE14.c.ii mentions energy sources for a powered USB hub, but RE14 also says "smartphone" robot controller device and RE14.c.ii refers only to connecting the hub to an Expansion Hub USB. Thus RE14 perhaps excludes the Control Hub USB. Q: Can a USB hub connected to a Control Hub be powered by sources listed in RE14.c.ii?

A: Yes, powered USB Hubs may only draw energy from the sources listed in RE14.c.ii.
