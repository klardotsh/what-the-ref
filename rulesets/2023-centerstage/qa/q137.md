# Q137: May a Human player place Pixels into the Field during Autonomous period?

Q: In the rulebook we could see no mention of a penalty for the Human Player placing Pixels in their Wing during Autonomous. Is it allowed for a Human Player to place Pixels during Autonomous for the purpose of scoring additional Pixels?

A: The answer that you seek is found by reading the |Human Player| constraints rule (GS12.b) in Game Manual Part 2.

No, |Drones| and |Pixels| may be placed or dropped into the |Wing| only during the |Driver-Controlled Period| per rule GS12.b. Each violation of this rule during the |Autonomous Period| or during the transition between the |Autonomous| and |Driver-Controlled Periods| results in a |Minor Penalty|.
