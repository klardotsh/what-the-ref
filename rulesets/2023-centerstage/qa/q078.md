# Q078: Clarification Q18 Robot Suspension in End Game

Q: Q18, A1 specified that after the 0:00 buzzer, the suspended robots may descend from the rigging without losing the bonus points. The flowchart in Section 4.4.7 of GM2 indicates that pressing stop on the Driver Station is the last action in Driver-Controlled Period. Pressing stop on the robot should depower motors used for hanging which will allow some robots to descend unpowered. Does such unpowered movement negate the ‘at rest’ condition for scoring purposes?

A: The answer that you seek is found by reading the description of the Robot location tasks in Game Manual Part 2 section 4.4.4 End Game.

Per section 4.4.4 in Game Manual Part 2, the |Robot| location (|Suspended| and |Parked|) |End Game Scoring| achievements are |Scored at the End of the Period|.

|Scored at the End of the Period| is defined in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2 as: "The achievement’s |Scoring| status is determined based on the |Robot| or |Scoring Element’s| position at the |End of the Period| (|Autonomous| or |Driver-Controlled|)". The |End of the Period| for the |Driver-Controlled Period| occurs when the scoring system |Match| timer reaches zero seconds (0:00) remaining in the |Match|. The condition "at rest" is intentionally omitted from the definition of |End of Period Scoring|. 

The Game Design Committee (GDC) selected |End of Period| |Scoring| for the |End Game| |Robot| location |Scoring| achievements for the reason stated in the question. After the required action of pressing the stop button on the |Driver Station|, |Robots| without a mechanical lock to maintain their position, are likely to lower to the |Playing Field Floor|. The GDC wants |Suspended Robots| at the |End of the Period| to earn the |Suspended| from the Rigging points, even if the |Robot| lowers and touches the |Playing Field Floor| after the |Match| ends and the |Driver Station| stop button is pressed.
