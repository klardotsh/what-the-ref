# Q202: Fiducial Legality under RM06c

Q: In GM1 RM06c, fiducial images of any type are disallowed for Robot construction. In Q192 and Q197, patterns, logos, and images of any type are interpreted as fiducial and disallowed under TE03 because of this. 

a) Does RM06c use the same definition of "fiducial", and thus prohibit use of patterns (such as patterned pocketing) and team/sponsor logos on team robots? 

b) Does RM06c concern any fiducial markings on COTS parts? A specific example would be the barcodes on Andymark NeveRest Motors.

A: The answers to Q192 and 197 have been updated as follows.  If this does not answer your question please re-submit.

Based on the feedback we have received from Teams and volunteers we are clarifying and relaxing the restrictions on the types of images that are allowed on the Team Prop. The intent of rule TE03b is:
1.	prevent the use of any object on the field that could confuse or distract other Robots.
2.	prevent the use of canned solutions to simplify the task of object identification.

Therefore, any image that resembles a QR code, AprilTag, or coded vision target is not allowed.  All other images such as team logos, sponsor logos, raised areas, cut outs, etc. are allowed, providing no other rule is violated. 

 Fiducials as part of a COTS label are allowed.
