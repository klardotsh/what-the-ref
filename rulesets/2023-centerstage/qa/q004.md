# Q004: <GS12> Game scoring elements in wing

Q: <GS12> line c: Human Players may place a maximum of two (2) Pixels or one (1) Drone In a Wing at a time. This has “or”. Is this in one human action? An action being human placing one or two elements, and pull back outside boundary, 
Other rule, <GS09> line d has 6 elements in wing.
