# Q006: Crossing Center Line

Q: Centerstage game setup has stacks of white pixels on both sides of the field.  Is a robot able to use the stacks across the field centerline during autonomous?

A: Yes, however, this is a risky |Autonomous Period| gameplay strategy. A |Robot| entering the opposing |Alliance's| half of the |Playing Field| during the |Autonomous Period| risks violating rule GS03.
