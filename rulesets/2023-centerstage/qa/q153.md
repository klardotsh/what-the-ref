# Q153: Is using a laser mouse sensor for odometry legal?

Q: Our team is wondering if it's legal to use a laser mouse sensor with SPI protocol(like PMW3389 from https://www.tindie.com/products/citizenjoe/pmw3389-motion-sensor/) using a laser, allowed by RE12c and connected to an I2C port on the REV control hub via I2C to SPI bridge(like https://www.mikroe.com/i2c-to-spi-click), because we can't connect the sensor to the hub via USB as it seems it's restricted by RE11a.

A: Yes, as long as the laser module complies with all applicable rules (i.e. RE12.c) and all protocol converters comply with sensor rules (i.e. RE11.f)
