# Q150: Possession Limit Clarification for Pixels on (but not scored on) Backdrop

Q: Do pixels that are in contact with or on the backdrop, but not scored on the backdrop, count towards the possession limit defined in GS05.a? Specifically, are they exempted from the possession limit as defined in GS05.c.v and Q57?

A: The answer that you seek is found by reading rule GS05.c.v and the definition of the defined term "|On|" in section 4.3 in Game Manual Part 2.

"|On|" is defined as: "An object that is physically in contact with and at least partially |Supported| by an object, surface, etc. is considered |On|. An object that is entirely |Supported| by an object, surface, etc. is |Completely On|."

Rule GS05.c.v: "|Pixels| |On| the |Backdrop| are exempt from the |Control|/|Possession| limit."

Yes, |Pixels| |On| the |Backdrop| are exempted from the rule GS05.a |Possession| limit.
