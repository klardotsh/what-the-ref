# Q128: Glide Path and Drone Legality

Q: Q1: In Q100 you cite a "glide path". Is this replacing the "non-ballistic trajectory" Q2: In the new "Is Your Drone Legal?" document, L2 clearly has wings, IL2 clearly has no wings, what is the place where there is "enough wing" between those two designs?

A: A1: Glide path and non-ballistic trajectory are interchangeable terms.

A2: FIRST strives to compose robot construction rules that can be applied objectively and consistently across all FIRST Tech Challenge competitions. Despite our best efforts to try and write a subjective rule, the application of is subjective. The Inspectors will be looking for |Drone| characteristics that have the general configuration of an airplane with a defined fuselage and wings that have a reasonable potential for providing meaningful aerodynamic lift. The "Is Your Drone Legal" guide and the |Robot| Inspector's guide are two resources we made available to teams and inspectors to help you in building legal drones.
