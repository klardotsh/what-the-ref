# Q010: Pre-Match configuration - drone storage

Q: 4.4.1 specifies pixel storage but says nothing about drone storage.  Are there any constraints on the quantity or starting location/configuration of drones in excess of the one pre loaded prior to the start?

A: |Drive Teams| are allowed to bring one (1) |Drone| to the competition |Playing Field| for a |Match|. The |Drone| is either |Pre-Loaded| or placed into their |Alliance's| |Pixel Storage| area during pre-|Match| set up.
