# Q015: Are light blue and pink legal Prop colors?

Q: TE02 says that the TGE (Prop) may include multiple shades of the assigned color, but can the Prop be made entirely of a shade of the assigned color?  So, could a Prop be light blue or pink since those are shades of blue and red?

A: Yes, light blue and pink are acceptable colors providing it is obvious to the field personnel which alliance the Team Prop belongs to.
