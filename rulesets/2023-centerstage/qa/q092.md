# Q092: Placement of Team Prop on the spike mark by field personnel

Q: Will the field personnel always try to place the team prop in the middle of the selected spike mark segment during randomization?

A: Yes.

||Note:|| Randomization relocation is not a precision activity, |Teams| should design their |Team Prop| detection system to tolerate some variation in placement location and/or orientation when it is relocated by field personnel to a different |Spike Mark|. The |Drive Team| should immediately alert field personnel if there is a significant issue with the |Team Prop's| centered location and/or orientation. Using the referee question box after the |Match| ends to alert the Head Referee about a significant issue with |Team Prop| location and/or orientation during randomization is too late to affect any |Match| outcome and it is not a justification to replay a |Match|.
