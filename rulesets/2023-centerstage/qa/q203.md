# Q203: Pipe height minimum

Q: The game manual 2 C-6 Truss and Rigging (pdf page 36) shows the fixed yellow pipe height to be "~14", allowing some height variation. But how much?  1/8"? 1/4"? 1"? 3"? Can FIRST provide a required minimum height so teams can be sure their robots will travel under the fixed pipe?  This is especially important at tournaments where field inspection can be done before matches.

A: We believe that the answers you are looking for can be found by reading and understanding G08 and the explanatory orange box below it in Game Manual Part 2.

The specification for the yellow bar height is approximately 14".  Applying the tolerances would suggest that a team should expect possible variations in the height of the yellow bars.  Teams should take into account the risks that come with not paying attention to these potential variations.

As is mentioned in the orange box, events strive to setup and maintain a much more accurate setup/placement of their fields and game elements, but teams should take the tolerances into consideration when designing and building their robots.
