# Q099: Follow up to answer to Q88 (descoring pixels)

Q: The answer to Q88 says that "...descoring two Pixels that are part of a completed Mosaic and a Set Bonus achievement. Receive four Minor Penalties as described below". What is the rule basis for the answer? <GS04> says "A Minor Penalty will be assessed for each Pixel that is descored.", which in the given example is only 2 pixels. I see no rule that gives penalties for descoring a mosaic or a set bonus.

A: Descoring is a change of state of a |Scoring Element| that reduces an |Alliance’s| total |Score|. Removing or repositioning a |Pixel On| the opposing |Alliance’s Backstage| has three potential descoring impacts on the |Score| (|On| the |Backdrop|, |Mosaic|, and |Set Line Bonus|). Per !Q88, a |Minor Penalty| is assessed for each descoring impact on the |Score|.

||Note:|| Applying separate |Minor Penalties| for each affected |Scoring| achievement properly compensates the |Alliance| for the descoring impact on their total |Score|.
