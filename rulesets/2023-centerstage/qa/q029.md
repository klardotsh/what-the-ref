# Q029: GoBilda Odometry Pods

Q: In past years, we have seen odometry kits banned.  Are GoBilda's new odometry pods legal, or do we need to continue to build our own?  https://www.gobilda.com/odometry-pod-43mm-width-48mm-wheel-2048-ppr-encoder/

A: Each new season brings a new set of Game Manuals and rules, it's never advised to make assumptions based on prior seasons. 

Rule RM02 this season includes a trio of exceptions, one of them allowing odometry kits.
