# Q045: 6.1 Eligibility for Advancement: Home Region

Q: Tennessee Valley Robotics sponsors a State Championship in Tennessee and Alabama. There are the only advancement competitions in Tennessee and Alabama.  Can teams in the Tennessee Valley region compete in both the Tennessee and Alabama State Championship for advancement to World and the Inspire Award?

A: Per the eligibility for advancement criteria outlined in section 6.1 of the Game Manual Part 1, teams may only advance from events within their home region. Teams may still compete in events outside of their home region, but are not eligible for advancement.

Teams competing outside of their home region are eligible to be judged for all awards except for the Inspire award. For all awards except Inspire, teams may be considered a finalist or winner of the award but are not eligible to advance. Teams are not eligible for consideration for the Inspire award, including 2nd and 3rd place Inspire spots, outside of their home region.
