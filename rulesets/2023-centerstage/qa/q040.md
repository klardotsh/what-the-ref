# Q040: Follow up to q25 and Exceptions to RM02

Q: In q25, it was asked if a complete swerve drivetrain kit is a legal COTS drive chassis. The given answer was "A complete drivetrain made up of illegal parts is not legal." Follow up questions: 1) Which of the components in the proposed COTS kit are illegal parts? It would comprise entirely of motion components (bearings, shafts, gears) and structural components (mounts, frame, screws). 2) Is a complete swerve drivetrain kit compromising only of parts allowed under <RM02> a legal COTS kit?

A: A swerve drive module, by its very design, takes a one degree of freedom (DOF) motion and adds additional degrees of freedom to change the motion - the total DOF is dependent on the implementation, but it is always more than one. These kinds of components are not allowed by RM02's single DOF restriction for COTS parts, whether bundled in a COTS drive chassis kit or not.
