# Q087: Field "April Tags"

Q: When we printed off the field "April Tags" at 100% on our printer, they did not measure 2" and 5" square, respectively. So we printed them off at 106%, and the sizes were correct, but the right (Tag ID: 10) and left (Tag ID: 7) dashed edges of the graphics were cut off. Does this matter?

A: Good job verifying the AprilTag size! All printers print differently, so this is a great pointer to all teams to verify the printed area for your printer. The dotted lines themselves are not critical to the detection of the AprilTags, they're there mostly as an indicator of the recommended whitespace around the tag. In our testing as long as there is still at least 50% of the whitespace remaining on the truncated side of the black square of the AprilTag body (compare the whitespace on the truncated side with the other sides) there should be no problem.
