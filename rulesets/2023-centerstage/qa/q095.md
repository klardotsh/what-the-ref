# Q095: Grappling Hook - Clarification

Q: This is an clarification on Q89. Which of the following would be considered launching the hook?

a) The hook is propelled from the robot attached with fishing line.
b) The hook is propelled from the robot attached with aircraft cable.
c) The hook is propelled from the robot attached with #25 chain (a safety hazard, yes, but a great hypothetical as we reduce degrees of freedom)
d) The hook is propelled from the robot attached to a spring-loaded linear slide.

A: Placing a hook onto the Rigging by a mechanism (arm, slider, etc.) and then winching on a cable to lift the Robot is allowed. Launching the hook where it travels independent of the Robot is illegal per Rule RG06,  regardless of what the connecting cable is made of, and will receive a G24 penalty (major plus yellow card). A1: illegal A2: illegal A3: illegal A4: As long as the hook remains attached to the slide until it is placed on the Rigging, then this mechanism is allowed.
