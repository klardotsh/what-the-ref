# Q178: Is there a minimum size requirement for the paper drone?

Q: Can we have a drone that only uses half or even smaller portion of the standard 8.5x11 paper?

A: There is no restriction on the minimum size of a Drone, Teams may use as much or as little of the allowed paper as they wish.  However, it is to a Team's benefit to be large enough for the Scoring Referee to see it from 12 - 18 feet away.  And the Team Numbers must be legible.
