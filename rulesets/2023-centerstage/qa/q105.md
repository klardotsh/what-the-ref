# Q105: Intel T265 request

Q: My team and many others have spent a lot of effort creating software based on Intel T265, not to mention the cost of acquiring it.

Please note that although T265 is stereoscopic, it is not used for vision at all. Teams use the estimated position it provides that s calculated by its internal algorithms that combine its camera views and its IMU. In our view it is essentially a alternate for dead wheel odometry.

We graciously request it be allowed as in previous years.

A: Game Manual Part 1 is the definitive answer as to the allowed use of cameras, either as Vision Cameras or as Vision Sensors. Both usages are limited to a single image sensor. Vision Cameras are additionally limited to provide image/video streams only

As such, the Intel T265 camera is not legal for use as it fails the image sensor limitation and provides other than just image/video stream data.
