# Q018: Suspend at end of the match

Q: Q1: Does a robot have to be suspended at the end of the match to count for suspend points? Q2: Does the robot still get the points for suspending if they suspend from the rigging at end game, make it obvious and unambiguous, and then come down off the rigging and go on the floor?

A: The answers that you seek are found by reading the description of the |Robot| location tasks in Game Manual Part 2 section 4.4.4 |End Game|.

A1: Yes, to earn 20 points for being |Suspended from the Rigging|, a |Robot| must be |Suspended| from the |Rigging| when the scoring system |Match| timer reaches zero seconds (0:00) remaining in the |Match|. After the |Match| ends, the |Robot| may remain |Suspended| or lower to the |Playing Field Floor| without affecting the previously earned 20 points for completing the |Suspended from the Rigging| achievement.

A2: No, a |Robot| located on the |Playing Field Floor| at the end of the |Match| (i.e., match time equals 0:00) does not satisfy the requirement of being |Suspended| by the |Rigging| at the |End of the Period|.
