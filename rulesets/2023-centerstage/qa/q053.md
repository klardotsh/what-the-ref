# Q053: Autonomous yellow pixel placement on the backdrop

Q: For the randomization in the autonomous period and placing the yellow pixel on the backdrop, it looks as if each location, 1, 2 & 3 all have 2 slots that the pixel can be placed in, or is it only the left most slot of that location?

A: The answer that you seek is found by viewing illustrations E-3, E-4, E-5, and E-6 in Appendix E of Game Manual Part 2.

Each randomization task |Spike Mark| location (left, center, and right) has two (2) slots on the |Backdrop| that the |Pixel| can be placed into.
