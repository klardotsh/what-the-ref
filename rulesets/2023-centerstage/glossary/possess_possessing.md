# Possess / Possessing

An object is Possessed by a |Robot| if, as the |Robot| moves or changes
orientation (for example, moves forward, turns, backs up, spins in place),
the object remains in approximately the same position relative to the |Robot|.
Objects Possessed by a Robot are considered to be |Controlled|, and they are
part of the |Robot|. See also |Control / Controlling|.
