A visual fiducial system, useful for a wide variety of tasks including
augmented reality, robotics, and camera calibration[^1]. Three (3) AprilTags
are affixed to each Backdrop to identify target locations for the |Autonomous|
randomization task outlined in section 4.4.2. Two additional sets of AprilTags
are placed at the audience side of the field for assistance with field
localization. Information about AprilTags may be found [here](https://ftc-
