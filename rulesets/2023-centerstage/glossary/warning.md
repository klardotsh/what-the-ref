# Warning

An alert given by a referee to an individual or group. Warnings are applied to
the entire |Team|, and they have no effect on an |Alliance|â€™s |Score|. Warnings
are used as a way to point out rule violations while not issuing formal |
Penalties|. Repeated Warnings throughout a |Competition| may escalate to
|Penalties| and/or Yellow/Red Cards.
