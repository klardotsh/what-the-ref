# In (Inside) / Completely In (Completely Inside)

An object that has crossed into the upwards vertical extension (i.e., at a right
angle to the |Playing Field Floor|) of a defined |Area|’s boundary is Inside
the |Area|. An object that is entirely within the upwards vertical extension
of a defined |Area|’s boundary is Completely Inside the |Area|. The boundary
element (tape, wall, markings, etc.) is part of the |Area| for the purposes of
determining Inside and |Outside|, unless otherwise specified.
