|Alliance Neutral| |Areas| outside the |Playing Field Perimeter| on the audience
side of the |Playing Field Wall|. There are three (3) Landing Zones:

1. Landing Zone 1 – A 144-inch (3.66 m) wide x 24-inch (610 mm) deep |Area| immediately adjacent
to the audience side Playing Field Wall.
2. Landing Zone 2 – A 144-inch (3.66 m) wide x 24-inch (610 mm) deep |Area| immediately adjacent
to Landing Zone 1.
3. Landing Zone 3 – A 144-inch (3.66 m) wide x 24-inch (610 mm) deep |Area| immediately adjacent
to Landing Zone 2.

The first white tape line from the |Playing Field Wall| is part of Landing Zone
1, the second white tape line is part of Landing Zone 2, and the third white
line is part of Landing Zone 3. (see Appendix C-9).

Recognize that Landing Zone surfaces and marking materials may vary from event
to event. Potential surfaces include hardwood floors, carpeting, gym tarp,
cement, tiles, mats, etc. Potential marking materials include tape, paint, etc.
|Teams| should plan for these variances when competing at different events.
