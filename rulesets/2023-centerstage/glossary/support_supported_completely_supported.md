# Support / Supported / Completely Supported

An object (i.e., |Robot|, |Scoring Element|, |Game Element|, etc.) is Supported
by another object if the second object is bearing at least some of the weight
of the first object. If the second object is bearing all the weight of the first
object, it is Completely Supported by the second object.
