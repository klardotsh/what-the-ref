# Score / Scoring

|Robots| earn points for their |Alliance| by interacting with |Scoring Elements|
and |Navigating| to specific |Areas| of the |Playing Field|.

The specific method for each Scoring achievement is stated in the achievement’s
description in Section 4.4. Individual Scoring achievements are determined by
one of three methods:

1. Scored as Completed: The achievement is considered Scored the moment it is
successfully completed, i.e., all criteria are met.
2. Scored at End of the Period: The achievement’s Scoring status is determined
based on the |Robot| or |Scoring Element|’s position at the |End of the Period|
(|Autonomous| or |Driver-Controlled|).
3. Scored at Rest: The achievement is considered Scored based on the position
of the |Robot| or |Scoring Element| when the entire field has come to rest after
the Period (|Autonomous| or |Driver-Controlled|) ends.

Use of the real-time scoring system display is intended to help the audience and
|Teams| keep up with the action on the |Playing Field| and give a general sense
of the |Match| Score. Those watching should keep in mind that the Scoring for
the |Match| is not official until the referees finalize the Score after the |End
of the Match|.
