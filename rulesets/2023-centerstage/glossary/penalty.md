# Penalty

The consequence imposed for a rule or procedure violation that is identified
by a referee. When a Penalty occurs, points will be added to the non-offending
|Alliance|’s |Score|. Penalties are further defined as Minor Penalties and
Major Penalties. Penalties may also escalate to the issuing of a Yellow Card
or Red Card as a result of a continued occurrence of a rule violation and upon
discretion of the |Referee|.

## Yellow Cards and Red Cards

In addition to rule violations explicitly listed in section 4.5, Yellow Cards
and Red Cards are used in the FIRST Tech Challenge to manage |Team| and |Robot|
behavior that does not align with the mission of FIRST. Yellow and Red Cards
are not limited to just the |Competition Area|. |Teams| that display egregious
behavior in the pit area, judging rooms, stands, or any other location of the
competition can be issued a Yellow or Red Card for egregious behavior.

Illegal behaviors that are repeated (3 or more times), or egregious behaviors
by a Robot or Team member at the competition can result in a Yellow and/
or Red Card. Yellow Cards are additive, meaning that a second Yellow Card
is automatically converted to a Red Card. A Team is issued a Red Card for
any subsequent incident in which they receive an additional Yellow Card, for
example, earning a second Yellow Card during a single Match.

Yellow and Red Cards may be issued on or off the competition field. For details,
please make sure to read the Competition Rules outlined in section 3.5 of the
[Game Manual Part 1 – Traditional Events](#manual-gm1-traditional).
