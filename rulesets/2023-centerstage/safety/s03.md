# S03: Safety Gear

All members of the |Drive Team| are required to wear approved eye protection and
shoes with closed toed and a closed back. If any member of the |Drive Team| is
not wearing these safety items, the referee will issue a |Warning| to the |Team|
member(s) and if the situation is not remedied within thirty (30) seconds, the
offending member(s) of the |Drive Team| must leave the |Competition Area| for
the remainder of the |Match| and may not be replaced by another |Team| member.
Failure to comply with a request to leave the |Competition Area| violates rule
<G30>. Repeated |Team| violations during the competition will escalate to an
entire |Team| |Warning|. Following the |Team| |Warning|, subsequent violations
by any member of the |Team| will result in a |Minor Penalty| for the |Alliance|.
