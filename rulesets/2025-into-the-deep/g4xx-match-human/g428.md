# G428: No wandering

[DRIVE TEAM](!!) members must remain in their designated [ALLIANCE AREA](!!).

1. [DRIVE TEAMS](!!) may be anywhere in their respective [ALLIANCE AREA](!!)
   during a [MATCH](!!).
2. [DRIVE TEAM](!!) members must be staged inside their respective [ALLIANCE
   AREA](!!) prior to [MATCH](!!) start.

> The intent of this rule is to prevent [DRIVE TEAM](!!) members from leaving
> their assigned [AREA](!!) during a [MATCH](!!) to gain a competitive
> advantage. For example, moving to another part of the [FIELD](!!) for better
> viewing, reaching into the [FIELD](!!), etc. Simply breaking the plane of the
> [AREA](!!) during normal [MATCH](!!) play is not a [FOUL](!!).
>
> Exceptions are granted in cases concerning safety and for actions that are
> inadvertent, [MOMENTARY](!!), and inconsequential.
