# G403: OpModes are stopped by the end of AUTO

[ROBOTS](!!) must no longer be running an [AUTO](!!) OpMode by the end of the
[AUTO](!!) period. This can be done by a [DRIVE TEAM](!!) member pressing the
(â– ) stop button on the [DRIVER STATION](!!) app, allowing the OpMode to
naturally end, or allowing the 30 second [AUTO](!!) timer to end the OpMode.
