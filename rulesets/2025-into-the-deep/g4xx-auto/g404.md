# G404: No AUTO opponent interference

[FIELD](!!) columns A, B, C constitute the blue side of the [FIELD](!!), and
columns D, E, F (Figure 9‑4) constitute the red side of the [FIELD](!!). During
[AUTO](!!) [ROBOTS](!!) may not:

1. contact an opposing [ALLIANCE’S](!!) [ROBOT](!!) which is completely within
   the opposing ALLIANCE’S half of the [FIELD](!!).
2. contact a pre-set [SAMPLE](!!) on the opposing ALLIANCE’S half of the
   [FIELD](!!).
3. move [SCORING ELEMENTS](!!) onto the opposing ALLIANCE’S half of the
   [FIELD](!!) outside of the [SUBMERSIBLE ZONE](!!).

> The intent of this rule is to protect [ROBOT](!!) actions performed while
> completely in their [ALLIANCE’S](!!) side of the [FIELD](!!). Navigating into
> the opposing [ALLIANCE’S](!!) side of the [FIELD](!!) during [AUTO](!!) is a
> risky gameplay strategy.
