# G406: ROBOTS are motionless at the end of TELEOP

[ROBOTS](!!) must no longer be actively controlled by [DRIVERS](!!) after the
end of the [TELEOP](!!) period. This can be done by a [DRIVE TEAM](!!) member
pressing the (â– ) stop button on the DRIVER STATION app or by discontinuing any
operation of the [ROBOT](!!) by the end of the [MATCH](!!) period.

> [DRIVE TEAMS](!!) should make their best effort to stop gameplay immediately
> at the end of the [MATCH](!!) period. The end of [MATCH](!!) period buzzer
> audio cue is approximately 3 seconds long and is used as an unofficial
> indicator to teams and [REFEREES](!!) that the [MATCH](!!) has ended.
