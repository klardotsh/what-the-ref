# G405: ROBOTS are motionless between AUTO and TELEOP

Any movement of the [ROBOT](!!) or any of its [MECHANISMS](!!) is not allowed
during the transition period between [AUTO](!!) and [TELEOP](!!).

> Teams may press buttons on their DRIVER STATION app to initialize or start a
> [TELEOP](!!) OpMode during the [AUTO](!!) to [TELEOP](!!) transition period.
> If the [INIT](!!) portion of the OpMode causes the [ROBOT](!!) to violate
> this rule (actuators moving or twitching in any way) then the team should
> wait until the [TELEOP](!!) period begins before pressing [INIT](!!).
