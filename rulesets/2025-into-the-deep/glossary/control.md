# Control

an action by a [ROBOT](!!) in which the [SCORING ELEMENT](!!) is fully
supported by or stuck in, on, or under the [ROBOT](!!) or it intentionally
pushes a [SCORING ELEMENT](!!) to a desired location or in a preferred
direction (i.e., herding). Typically, CONTROL requires one of the following to
be true:

a. The [SCORING ELEMENT](!!) is fully supported by the [ROBOT](!!)
b. The [ROBOT](!!) is moving the [SCORING ELEMENT](!!) in a preferred direction
   with a flat or concave face of the [ROBOT](!!)
