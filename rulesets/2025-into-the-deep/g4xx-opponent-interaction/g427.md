# G427: Climbing ROBOTS are protected

In the last 30 seconds of the MATCH, a [ROBOT](!!) may not contact (either
directly or transitively through a [SCORING ELEMENT](!!) [CONTROLLED](!!) by
either [ROBOT](!!) and regardless of who initiates contact) an opponent
[ROBOT](!!) if any part of either [ROBOT](!!) is in the opponentâ€™s [ASCENT
ZONE](!!). Exceptions to this rule are as follows:

1. Contact occurring while both [ROBOT](!!)S have achieved [LEVEL](!!) 2 or
   [LEVEL](!!) 3 [ASCENT](!!).

> Teams should be aware that the [SUBMERSIBLE ZONE](!!) is a constrained space
> and [ROBOTS](!!) swinging during their [ASCENT](!!) may contact each other
> and teams should design their [ROBOTS](!!) to be resilient to incidental
> contact.
>
> [ROBOTS](!!) that are attempting to play defense within the [SUBMERSIBLE
> ZONE](!!) or the [ASCENT ZONES](!!) during the last 30 seconds of the
> [MATCH](!!) are likely to incur penalties.
