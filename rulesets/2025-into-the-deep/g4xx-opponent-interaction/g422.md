# G422: Do not tip or entangle

A [ROBOT](!!) may not deliberately, as perceived by a [REFEREE](!!), attach to,
tip, or entangle an opponent [ROBOT](!!).

> Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to:
>
> 1. using a wedge-like [MECHANISM](!!) to tip over an opponent [ROBOT](!!)
> 2. making frame-to-frame contact with an opponent [ROBOT](!!) that is
>    attempting to right itself after previously falling over and causing them
>    to fall over.
> 3. causing an opponent [ROBOT](!!) to tip over by contacting the [ROBOT](!!)
>    after it starts to tip if, in the judgement of the [REFEREE](!!), that
>    contact could have been avoided.
>
> Tipping as an unintended consequence of normal [ROBOT](!!)-to-[ROBOT](!!)
> interaction, including single frame-to-frame hits that result in a
> [ROBOT](!!) tipping, as perceived by the [REFEREE](!!), is not a violation of
> this rule.
>
> "Unable to drive" means that because of the incident, the [DRIVER](!!) can no
> longer drive to a desired location in a reasonable time (generally). For
> example, if a [ROBOT](!!) can only move in circles, or can only move
> extremely slowly, the [ROBOT](!!) is considered unable to drive.
