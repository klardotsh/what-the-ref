# G423: There is a 5-count on PINS

A [ROBOT](!!) may not [PIN](!!) an opponentâ€™s [ROBOT](!!) for more than 5
seconds. A [ROBOT](!!) is [PINNING](!!) if it is preventing the movement of an
opponent [ROBOT](!!) by contact, either direct or transitive (such as against a
[FIELD](!!) element) and the opponent [ROBOT](!!) is attempting to move. A
[PIN](!!) count ends once any of the following criteria below are met:

1. the [ROBOTS](!!) have separated by at least 2 ft. (~61 cm) from each other
   for more than 5 seconds,
2. either [ROBOT](!!) has moved 2 ft. from where the [PIN](!!) initiated for
   more than 5 seconds, or
3. the [PINNING](!!) [ROBOT](!!) gets [PINNED](!!).

For criteria A, the [PIN](!!) count pauses once [ROBOT](!!)S are separated by 2
ft. until either the [PIN](!!) ends or the [PINNING](!!) [ROBOT](!!) moves back
within 2 ft., at which point the [PIN](!!) count is resumed.

For criteria B, the [PIN](!!) count pauses once either [ROBOT](!!) has moved
2ft from where the [PIN](!!) initiated until the [PIN](!!) ends or until both
[ROBOTS](!!) move back within 2ft., at which point the [PIN](!!) count is
resumed.
