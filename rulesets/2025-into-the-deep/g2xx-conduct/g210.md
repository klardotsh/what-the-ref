# G210: Do not expect to gain by doing others harm

Actions clearly aimed at forcing the opponent [ALLIANCE](!!) to violate a rule
are not in the spirit of FIRST Tech Challenge and not allowed. Rule violations
forced in this manner will not result in an assignment of a penalty to the
targeted [ALLIANCE](!!).

> This rule does not apply for strategies consistent with standard gameplay, for example:
>
> 1. a red [ALLIANCE](!!) [ROBOT](!!) in their [ASCENT ZONE](!!) in the final
>    30 seconds of the [MATCH](!!) contacts a blue [ALLIANCE](!!) [ROBOT](!!)
> 2. a red [ROBOT](!!) attempts to enter their [NET ZONE](!!) to place a
>    [SPECIMEN](!!) and pushes a blue [ROBOT](!!) that was less than 1
>    [TILE](!!) away into the [NET ZONE](!!).

> This rule requires an intentional act with limited or no opportunity for the
> team being acted on to avoid the penalty, such as:
>
> 1. trapping an opposing [ALLIANCE](!!) [ROBOT](!!) in your [ALLIANCE](!!)’S
>    [ASCENT ZONE](!!) during the last 30 seconds of the [MATCH](!!).
> 2. pushing an opposing [ALLIANCE](!!) [ROBOT](!!) into your [ALLIANCE](!!)’S
>    [OBSERVATION ZONE](!!) intentionally or from more than 1 [TILE](!!) away.
> 3. placing your [ALLIANCE](!!) SPECIFIC SAMPLE or [SPECIMEN](!!) in an
>    opposing [ALLIANCE](!!)’S [ROBOT](!!).
> 4. a [ROBOT](!!) becomes pinned in their opposing [ALLIANCE](!!)’S
>    [OBSERVATION ZONE](!!) by the opposing [ALLIANCE](!!) [ROBOT](!!)
