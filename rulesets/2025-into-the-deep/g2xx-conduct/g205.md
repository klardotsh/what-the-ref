# G205: Throwing your own MATCH is bad

A team may not intentionally lose a [MATCH](!!) in an effort to lower their own
ranking and/or manipulate the rankings of other teams.

> The intent of this rule is not to punish teams who are employing alternate
> strategies, but rather to ensure that it is clear that throwing [MATCHES](!!)
> to negatively affect your own rankings, or to manipulate the rankings of
> other teams (e.g., throw a [MATCH](!!) to lower a partner's ranking, and/or
> increase the ranking of another team not in the [MATCH](!!)) is incompatible
> with FIRST values and not a strategy any team should employ.
