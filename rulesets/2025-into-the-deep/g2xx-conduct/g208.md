# G208: Enter only 1 ROBOT

Each registered FIRST Tech Challenge team may enter only 1 [ROBOT](!!) (or
“robot,” a [ROBOT](!!)-like assembly equipped with most of its [CHASSIS](!!),
i.e., A [ROBOT](!!)’S [MAJOR MECHANISM](!!) that enables it to move around a
[FIELD](!!)) into a FIRST Tech Challenge event. Each registered FIRST Tech
Challenge team may only participate in one concurrent event at a time.

> “Entering” a [ROBOT](!!) (or robot) into a FIRST Tech Challenge means
> bringing it to or using it at the event such that it is an aid to your team
> (e.g., for spare parts, judging material, or for practice).
>
> While “most of its drive base” is a subjective assessment, for the purposes
> of this rule, an assembly whose drive base is missing all wheels/treads,
> gearboxes, and belts/chains is not considered a “[ROBOT](!!).” If any of
> those [COMPONENTS](!!) are incorporated, the assembly is now considered a
> “[ROBOT](!!).”
>
> This rule does not prohibit teams from bringing in [ROBOTS](!!) from other
> FIRST programs for the purposes of awards presentations or pit displays.
>
> It is expected that teams will update, make changes and may even build
> multiple [ROBOTS](!!) in the course of a season, this rule only applies to
> bringing multiple different [ROBOTS](!!) to a single event.
