# G203: Asking other teams to throw a MATCH – not cool

A team may not encourage an [ALLIANCE](!!) of which it is not a member to play
beneath its ability.

NOTE: This rule is not intended to prevent an [ALLIANCE](!!) from planning
and/or executing its own strategy in a specific [MATCH](!!) in which all the
teams are members of the [ALLIANCE](!!).

> Example 1: A [MATCH](!!) is being played by teams A and B, in which team B is
> encouraged by team D to not achieve a LEVEL 3 [ASCENT](!!), resulting in
> teams A and B losing the [MATCH](!!). Team D’s motivation for this behavior
> is to prevent team A from rising in the tournament rankings and negatively
> affecting team D’s ranking. Team D has violated this rule.
>
> Example 2: A [MATCH](!!) is being played by teams A and B, in which team A is
> assigned to participate as a [SURROGATE](!!). Team D encourages team A not to
> participate in the [MATCH](!!) so that team D gains ranking position over
> team B. Team D has violated this rule.
>
> Example 3: Asking a team to “no show” for a [MATCH](!!).
>
> FIRST considers the action of a team influencing another team to throw a
> [MATCH](!!), to deliberately lower their tie breaker scores, etc.
> incompatible with FIRST values and not a strategy any team should employ.
