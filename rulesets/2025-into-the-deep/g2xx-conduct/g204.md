# G204: Letting someone coerce you into throwing a MATCH – also not cool

A team, as the result of encouragement by a team not on their [ALLIANCE](!!),
may not play beneath its ability.

NOTE: This rule is not intended to prevent an [ALLIANCE](!!) from planning
and/or executing its own strategy in a specific [MATCH](!!) in which all the
[ALLIANCE](!!) members are participants.

> Example 1: A [MATCH](!!) is being played by Teams A and B, in which Team B is
> encouraged by Team D to not achieve a LEVEL 3 [ASCENT](!!). Team B accepts
> this request. Team D’s motivation for this behavior is to prevent Team A from
> rising in the tournament rankings and negatively affecting Team D’s ranking.
> Team B has violated this rule.
>
> Example 2: A [MATCH](!!) is being played by Teams A and B, in which Team A is
> assigned to participate as a [SURROGATE](!!). Team A accepts Team D’s request
> to not participate in the [MATCH](!!) so that Team D gains ranking position
> over Team B. Team A has violated this rule.
>
> FIRST considers the action of a team influencing another team to throw a
> [MATCH](!!), to deliberately miss [RANKING POINTS](!!), etc. incompatible
> with FIRST values and not a strategy any team should employ.
