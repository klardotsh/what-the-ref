# G302: You can only bring/use specific items to the MATCH

The only equipment that may be brought to the [ARENA](!!) for a [MATCH](!!) is
listed below. Regardless of if equipment fits criteria below, it may not be
employed in a way that breaks any other rules, introduces a safety hazard,
blocks visibility for [FIELD STAFF](!!) or audience members, or jams or
interferes with the remote sensing capabilities of another team or the
[FIELD](!!).

1. the [ROBOT](!!)
2. the [OPERATOR CONSOLE](!!)
3. [ROBOT](!!) carts (which may contain basic tools and supplies to maintain
   the [ROBOT](!!))
4. non-powered signaling devices
5. reasonable decorative items
6. special clothing and/or equipment required due to a disability
7. devices (e.g., laptop, tablet, phone) used solely for planning, tracking,
   and communicating strategy within the same designated area (e.g., [ALLIANCE
   AREA](!!))
8. devices used solely to record gameplay
9. non-powered Personal Protective Equipment (examples include, but arenâ€™t
   limited to, gloves, eye protection, and hearing protection)

conditions:

   category I).
2. does not communicate with anything or anyone outside of the [ARENA](!!).
3. does not include any form of enabled wireless electronic communication with
   the exception of medically required equipment.
4. does not in any way affect the outcome of a [MATCH](!!), other than by
   allowing the [DRIVE TEAM](!!) to

* plan or track strategy for the purposes of communication of that strategy to
  other [ALLIANCE](!!) members or
* use items allowed per D to communicate with the [ROBOT](!!).

> Use of imagery that, to a reasonably astute observer, mimics the AprilTags
> employed on the [FIELD](!!) is a violation of this rule.
>
> Examples of wireless communication include, but are not limited to, radios,
> walkie-talkies, cell phones, Bluetooth communications, and Wi-Fi.
