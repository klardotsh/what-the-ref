# G304: Teams must select an OpMode

An OpMode must be selected on the [DRIVER STATION](!!) app and initialized by
pressing the [INIT](!!) button. If this OpMode is an [AUTO](!!) OpMode, the 30
second [AUTO](!!) timer must be enabled.

> This rule requires all teams to select and [INIT](!!) an OpMode regardless of
> whether or not an [AUTO](!!) OpMode is planned to be used during [AUTO](!!).
> [FIELD STAFF](!!) will use this as an indication that a team is ready to
> start the [MATCH](!!).
>
> Teams without an [AUTO](!!) OpMode should consider creating a default
> [AUTO](!!) OpMode using the BasicOpMode sample and use the auto-loading
> feature to automatically queue up their [TELEOP](!!) OpMode.
