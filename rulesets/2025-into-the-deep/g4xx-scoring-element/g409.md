# G409: Do not damage SCORING ELEMENTS

Neither a [ROBOT](!!) nor a [HUMAN PLAYER](!!) may damage a [SCORING
ELEMENT](!!).

> [SCORING ELEMENTS](!!) are expected to undergo a reasonable amount of wear
> and tear as they are handled by [ROBOTS](!!) and humans, such as scratching,
> marking, and eventually damage due to fatigue. Routinely gouging, tearing off
> pieces, or marking [SCORING ELEMENTS](!!) are violations of this rule.
