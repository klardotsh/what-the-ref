# G410: 1 SAMPLE or SPECIMEN at a time

A [ROBOT](!!) may not [CONTROL](!!) more than 1 [SAMPLE](!!) or 1
[SPECIMEN](!!) at a time, either directly or transitively through other
objects. There is no limit to the number of [CLIPS](!!) a [ROBOT](!!) may
possess.

A [ROBOT](!!) is in [CONTROL](!!) of a [SAMPLE](!!) or [SPECIMEN](!!) if:

1. the [SAMPLE](!!) or [SPECIMEN](!!) is fully supported by the [ROBOT](!!) or
2. it intentionally pushes a [SAMPLE](!!) or [SPECIMEN](!!) to a desired
   location or in a preferred direction (i.e., herding, often with a concave
   surface)

Exceptions to this rule are as follows:

*NOTE FROM WHAT THE REF: These are (c) and (d) in the manual. Due to a fun
interaction of the on-disk data format of WTR and the layers of conversion to
get it to your eyeballs now, it gets coerced into being (a) and (b). Sorry,
this probably isn't fixable in any reasonable timeframe!*

1. [ROBOTS](!!) may [MOMENTARILY](!!) exceed [CONTROL](!!) limits while
   collecting [SAMPLES](!!) that are in the [SUBMERSIBLE ZONE](!!).
2. scored [SAMPLES](!!) or [SPECIMENS](!!) for the corresponding [ALLIANCE](!!)
   are exempt from the [CONTROL](!!) limit.

> Examples of interaction with a [SAMPLE](!!) or [SPECIMEN](!!) that are not
> “[CONTROL](!!)” include, but are not limited to:
>
> 1. PLOWING or “bulldozing” (inadvertent contact with a [SAMPLE](!!) or
>    [SPECIMEN](!!), typically via a flat or convex surface, while in the path
>    of the [ROBOT](!!) moving about the FIELD).
> 2. “deflecting” (being hit by a [SAMPLE](!!) or [SPECIMEN](!!) that bounces
>    off a [ROBOT](!!)).
>
> Excessive violations of [CONTROL](!!) limits include, but are not limited to,
> simultaneous [CONTROL](!!) of 3 or more [SAMPLE](!!)S and/or [SPECIMEN](!!)S,
> or frequent, greater-than [MOMENTARY](!!) [CONTROL](!!) (i.e., more than
> twice in a [MATCH](!!)) of 2 or more [SCORING ELEMENTS](!!). [REPEATED](!!)
> excessive violations of this rule do not result in additional YELLOW CARDS
> unless the violation reaches the level of egregious to trigger a [G201](!!)
> violation.
