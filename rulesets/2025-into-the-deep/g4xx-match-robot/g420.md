# G420: No climbing on the inside

[ROBOTS](!!) must start their [ASCENT](!!) with their [CHASSIS](!!) completely
outside the [SUBMERSIBLE ZONE](!!).

> The purpose of this rule is to limit how much of the [ROBOT](!!) may be
> inside the [SUBMERSIBLE ZONE](!!) before the [ASCENT](!!) begins. [ROBOT](!!)
> elements are allowed to reach into the [SUBMERSIBLE ZONE](!!) while
> attempting to [ASCEND](!!), as long as the [ROBOT](!!) [CHASSIS](!!) remains
> completely outside the [SUBMERSIBLE ZONE](!!). It is expected that there will
> be some contact between opponent [ROBOTS](!!) within the [SUBMERSIBLE
> ZONE](!!), and this is intended to minimize the extent of that contact.
