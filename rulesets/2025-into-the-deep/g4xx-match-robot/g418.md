# G418: Horizontal expansion limit

After the [MATCH](!!) has started, [ROBOTS](!!) may expand beyond the [STARTING
CONFIGURATION](!!) but are still subject to sizing constraints. The sizing
constraints are specified in [R104](!!).

> This rule is intended to limit the amount of floor area each [ROBOT](!!) can
> cover with the maximum range of motion of all extensions. All possible
> movement of extensions outside the [STARTING CONFIGURATION](!!) must be
> constrained as described in [R104](!!).
>
> During the [MATCH](!!) REFEREES may use [ARENA](!!) elements to help gauge
> [ROBOT](!!) expansion during the [MATCH](!!). For example:
>
> 1. [TILES](!!) are approximately 24 in. (~61 cm)
> 2. The [RUNGS](!!) on the [SUBMERSIBLE](!!) are 44.5 in. (~113 cm) wide
>
> REFEREES that observe [ROBOTS](!!) that are in violation of this rule may
> request the [ROBOT](!!) be reinspected.
