# G413: ROBOTS must be safe

A [ROBOT](!!) may not pose an undue hazard to a human, an [ARENA](!!) element,
or another [ROBOT](!!) in the following ways:

1. the [ROBOT](!!) or anything it [CONTROLS](!!), i.e., a [SCORING
   ELEMENT](!!), contacts anything outside the [FIELD](!!).
2. its operation or design is dangerous or unsafe.


> Examples of dangerous operation or designs that likely pose undue hazards
> include, but are not limited to:
>
> 1. uncontrolled motion that cannot be stopped by the [DRIVE TEAM](!!),
> 2. [ROBOT](!!) parts “flailing” outside of the [FIELD](!!),
> 3. [ROBOTS](!!) dragging their battery, and
> 4. [ROBOTS](!!) that consistently extend outside the [FIELD](!!).
>
> Please be conscious of REFEREES and [FIELD STAFF](!!) working around the
> [ARENA](!!) who may be in close proximity to your [ROBOT](!!).
